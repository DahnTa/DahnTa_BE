2024-10-02,"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter","Tesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890

Total production Q3 2024: 469,796

Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.

Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It’s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.

In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.

Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.

In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.

GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla’s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company’s total sales.

Ford plans to report results on Wednesday.

Tesla hasn’t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.

The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.

Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.

Tesla’s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called “racist hate,” and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.

But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.

In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.

Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of “dedicated robotaxi.”

Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",1698,561

2024-10-13,"Ride-sharing giants Uber, Lyft jump after Tesla’s ‘toothless taxi’ fails to excite investors","Tesla’s hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber’s ride-sharing aspirations, but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead.

Uber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday’s event — particularly slumping in early August and mid-September — but surged more than 9% on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52-week high and it was leading the S&P 500 higher during the session.

That is a massive turnaround for Uber’s stock, which is now up nearly 22% over the past month and about 38% for the year. Lyft, another major player, is also surging about 10% on Friday. By comparison, Tesla’s shares are plunging during Friday’s trading session and are down more than 11% this year, vastly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, which have each gained around 22% so far this year.

The buzz around Tesla’s highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self-driving technology advancements and the company’s failure to provide insight on its ride-sharing service strategy or economics, among other expectations investors had.

“TSLA’s toothless taxi is a best-case outcome for UBER,” Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note, noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.

2024-10-24,$TSLA: The DD of a lifetime. ,"Hello, everyone! As we all know, $TSLA is having their quarterly earnings, which is a big deal for some bears. But let’s crack down on the bear party just for a second and use *logical* reasoning for why TSLA might not end up in the gutter as many would think. 

1. Expectations are low, just like Q1 (will get back to this later).
2. Their shittiness is priced in already after Robotaxi event.
3. Elon Musk is a master stock manipulator. 

Keeping all of this in mind, this isn’t even the *real* part of this DD. The actual, most integral part is looking at Elon Musk’s Twitter, which I decided to keep a close look on the past couple of earnings reports. 

On the day of Tesla’s Q1, Elon Musk tweeted a total of 5 times, where the stock ended up going up 13% and then an additional 16% the next 2 weeks. 

On the day of Tesla Q2, Elon Musk didn’t tweet **anything**, and the stock ended up falling 14%. 

Seems like a pattern has been drawn up, huh? Elon tweets a bit when the Tesla stock is going to moon on earnings while he’s in a cocky mood, and is dead silent when Tesla is going to fall. 

Now guess how many times Elon Musk has tweeted *so far* today? 

*15 fucking times*. 

You heard that right, folks! 15 GODDAMN times. That’s triple the amount of tweets he had made on Q1, where the stock roared 13 - 15%! Meaning that Elon is much more confidence and cockier than he was in Q1! This man knows when his stock will fall and when it doesn’t, and he’s letting us know right below our own nose! 

All of this is a *clear* indicator that Tesla is going to the moon today and the next week to come, regardless of whether they beat estimates or not. I’m betting that Tesla WILL beat estimates simply because of Elon Musk’s tweets and the fact that everyone has low confidence in the stock as of late. 

This is your DD to buy calls. Whether you want free money or not is up to you. 

Positions: 15 minutes before market close, I’ll buy 3 217.5C exp. OCT. 25th. 

*note*: This is NOT financial advice. Any losses on $TSLA options deep OOTM is a result of your regardedness, not mine. ",3882,547
2024-10-24,Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat,"* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

# 

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. ""As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time,"" noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our ""We, Robot"" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.",334,474

2024-11-18,"Trump Team Eyes Rule Overhaul for Self-Driving Regulations, Potential Catalyst to Boost Tesla's Subscription Revenue","The Trump transition team is prioritizing the development of a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles, aiming to revise current regulations that limit the deployment of autonomous cars without human controls. This move aligns with the interests of Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO and a prominent Trump supporter, who is heavily invested in autonomous technology, including plans to launch driverless Tesla robotaxis by 2026.

Current regulations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) allow only 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under exemptions, creating barriers for Tesla and other manufacturers aiming for large-scale deployment. The Trump team is exploring leadership options for the Transportation Department, including former Uber executive Emil Michael, to craft policies that could facilitate mass adoption. Bipartisan legislative efforts to increase deployment caps and establish federal rules for autonomous vehicles have faced repeated setbacks, including challenges in Congress and failed compromises during the Biden administration.

Musk, who has been appointed alongside entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead Trump’s ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" is advocating for streamlined regulations and has pledged to push for policies enabling nationwide use of autonomous vehicles. The initiative has raised concerns among rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft, whose stock prices dipped following Musk’s announcements.

The push reflects broader ambitions to dismantle regulatory hurdles and advance emerging technologies under the Trump administration, though significant legislative and bureaucratic challenges remain.

2024-11-30,Thesis: A Food  for Though on Fundamentals of TSLA in Relationship to the Era When Warren Buffet Was Born,"Hi investing friends, granted calculations say TSLA is overbought by around 7 to 8x  but if we go back in time and imagine it's today, could TSLA be at an era when it was good for Warren to buy Wrigley's stocks or Coca Cola stocks?

I get Buffett's picks which are first en masse, second they are consumables, 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster(nothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and there's nothing hard about chewing and drinking Coke), 4th don't require R and D at some point, I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.

Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).

2024-12-01,A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry,"Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).

Tesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ""ate it's own cake too"" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).

2024-12-16,2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~24% and \~16%.",832,182

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~24% and \~16%.",832,182
2024-12-18,"""Tesla Is Most Expensive Mag 7 Stock. This Is How Much It Needs to Earn to Justify It."" from Barrons","The others trade for 29 times expected 2025 earnings. Tesla is at 130 times. It has gone up 73% since the election and is going up so much, so fast that even sycophantic analysts cannot keep up. 

""Investors believe two things will drive earnings estimates higher. One matters more than the other. The first is a new model in 2025 which CEO Elon Musk believes will drive volumes in 2025 to about 2.3 million units, [up about 25%](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/tesla-stock-price-earnings-today?mod=article_inline) and about 200,000 cars more than Wall Street projects. Selling more cars is great for a car company, but that isn’t what investors are most excited about.

That would be [self-driving robotaxis](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-robotaxi-day-elon-musk-ec7050c2?mod=article_inline). Tesla plans to launch a self-driving robotaxi service in late 2025. It doesn’t appear to be reflected in Wall Street earnings targets yet. Analysts are waiting.

...It’s possible to work backward from the P/E. To trade at an average trillion-dollar P/E ratio, Tesla needs to earn roughly $50 billion a year. The car business is expected to earn about $10 billion in the coming years. Robotaxis need to earn roughly $40 billion a year to square Tesla’s valuation with the rest of the Magnificent Seven (plus Broadcom).""

2024-12-18,2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

2024-12-19,$TSLA how much growth of tesla justifies their P/E of 120?,"I believe tesla does have huge growth potential mainly through their autonomous technology and humanoid robots, but I personally believe it is overvalued right now.

How would you calculate this?

“We had a problem” with Musk’s pay package, a spokesperson for Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP said Sunday. The fund also considered costs, return and responsible investment requirements in its decision to sell its investment.

The news was first reported by Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad, which also cited poor working conditions at the company among ABP’s reasons to ditch Tesla.

Last month, Musk’s record-setting Tesla pay package was struck down once again by a Delaware judge even after shareholders backed the amounts and Musk asked her to reconsider. The stock options package was initially worth $2.6 billion and spiked to $56 billion by the time the judge canceled it.

Introduction: I have been very lucky this year playing puts and calls. I am already up over $103k since 1/1 and I have the receipts. (See my post history for some) So cry me a river indeed.

[Year to date gains in Etrade of $103k for 2025.](https://preview.redd.it/4vqv7g2chnde1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fa24697a1b42441ea4e3fbf31d43befc36709cb)

Nearly every single play has been buying puts when things seem irrationally high, or buying calls when they've fallen too far? What is too far? Good question. But to play this, you need volume and volatility.

$CEG (Constellation Energy Group) has been the perfect trade for that this year. Four times on three separate days I've bought puts on their frothiness. Yesterday I made $20k off $CEG in about an hour. Good work if you can get it.

[CEG Puts have gotten me $35k in gains even though the stock is up.](https://preview.redd.it/qemqizdvhnde1.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=5152767c694055798a43636ece96772a6b02faa4)

So that brings us to today. It's Friday, 0 Day Expiration party time! This morning, lots of things are green, and meme stock Elon plaything Tesla is blowing up like a SpaceX rocket over the Carribean. I am ready to make a killing. It's up 5% from the previous day and, if my results this year are right, it's going to go down. Everything returns to the mean. Nothing finishes at the high of the day.

So I buy 200 Put options for $1.24 at $430. It's a $25k bet and my account is ready.

[TSLA looking frothy midway through the day as I buy puts at 430.](https://preview.redd.it/k67m63joinde1.png?width=464&format=png&auto=webp&s=47da208c002804913328eb67a5dc5b96ba08f465)

But it doesn't go down right away. This is fine, I tell myself as the stock goes up to 436, 437... So I decide to double down and buy 150 put options for $1.46 at $435. It's a $22k bet. I've now got $47k on the line, about half my gains on the year. If the stock traces back to $430, it'll be great. $425 would make serious coin.

But I forgot Tesla stock is fucking insane and every regard in this sub is jerking it to this chart.

[TSLA nears $440 with an hour left in trading and I am seriously boned.](https://preview.redd.it/bph2h3o8jnde1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fa161caad811a9726e6aae0d48320d99b096a05)

At this point, I have the live chart on my screen and I know I am going to eat shit and be down more than $40k and wipe out everything I've scammed for this year. Every time it comes down to 437, it goes back up to 439. 438. 439. 438. Stupid TSLA.

But wait! With an hour left it starts to fall, just like I thought it would. To $434 at least. My second buy is green more than $10k while my first one is pretty much toast. Every tick up or down is the worst. With less than an hour ago the flip flopping continues. $432. Back up to $433. I realize I am up $21k on one put and down $17k on the other put. I panic sell both and leave with $3k gains. Survival! I was stunned any dork bought my obviously dead put with minutes left.

So what happens? $TSLA crashes (of course) all the way to $426.50 at end of day. I was right.

[TSLA nears $440 with an hour left in trading and I am seriously boned.](https://preview.redd.it/bph2h3o8jnde1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fa161caad811a9726e6aae0d48320d99b096a05)

At this point, I have the live chart on my screen and I know I am going to eat shit and be down more than $40k and wipe out everything I've scammed for this year. Every time it comes down to 437, it goes back up to 439. 438. 439. 438. Stupid TSLA.

But wait! With an hour left it starts to fall, just like I thought it would. To $434 at least. My second buy is green more than $10k while my first one is pretty much toast. Every tick up or down is the worst. With less than an hour ago the flip flopping continues. $432. Back up to $433. I realize I am up $21k on one put and down $17k on the other put. I panic sell both and leave with $3k gains. Survival! I was stunned any dork bought my obviously dead put with minutes left.

So what happens? $TSLA crashes (of course) all the way to $426.50 at end of day. I was right.

[End of day: $TSLA at $426.5 after hitting $439 intraday](https://preview.redd.it/l2459uecknde1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=74e4ed83b0c3897783421e490ef372230d2d2177)

So let's do the math on those puts:  
$435 - $426.5 = $8.5 \* 150 \* 100 = $127,500  
$430 - $426.5 = $3.5 \* 200 \* 100 = $70,000

I would have cleared $197,500 instead of $3,200 because I was a paper handed bitch and didn't want to lose $47k. This is the worst $3k I've ever made. FML. ",734,197

2025-02-04,Tesla’s Valuation: Speculation or Real Growth? My DCF Insights,"I did a quick and dirty DCF valuation for TSLA, and here’s what I found. I don’t own TSLA individually; I only have exposure through the S&P. However, with recent events, I’ve been wondering why people hold TSLA.

My typical process when looking into a company starts with a DCF to gauge approximately what the company should currently be valued at. I know, I know, it’s not perfect, but it’s a way to get started.

For TSLA, I averaged the last three years of free cash flow (FCF) at about $5.1 billion. I used a 5% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth rate of 3%, along with a discount rate of 12%. All these estimates are generous for a few reasons: the share count is increasing, FCF has declined over the past three years, and the risk is high.

With these assumptions, I came up with a value of $26.24, which is only 6.85% of the current price. This means that 93% of the value is based on future growth and speculation.

Now, many people assume that Tesla will revolutionize humanoid robots and self-driving cars, so I took a more optimistic approach to the DCF. I used a 20% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth of 7%, which is probably unrealistic. Using the same discount rate, I arrived at a value of $52.62. This represents 13.74% of the current value, meaning 86.26% is based on even more future growth and potential.

With all that said, it’s hard for me to understand what people see in this company. Or am I just thinking the wrong way, and it has nothing to do with making money?

Tesla’s stock is sitting around $330 per share, up 75% from last year, but I’m struggling to see how it justifies the current valuation.

Here’s a list of what bothers me:

1. **Elon Musk’s PR Nightmare** – It’s hard to ignore how much Musk’s public image has deteriorated. Between the “Sieg Heil” incident on live TV and his controversial actions, he’s lost a lot of credibility, and by extension, Tesla’s brand has taken a serious hit. A lot of people now see him and the company as 'problematic'.

1. **Competition Is Catching Up Fast** – Tesla used to be the only game in town when it came to EVs and FSD, but that’s no longer the case. Other automakers are making significant strides in both areas, and some are already ahead in terms of technology and innovation.

1. **Declining Profit Margins** – Tesla’s profit margins have been shrinking year after year. This is concerning for a company that’s valued at over a trillion dollars. If this trend continues, it could put a major dent in their long-term prospects.

1. **The Cybertruck Disaster** – The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla’s next big thing, but it’s turned into more of a meme. The build quality issues and the general lack of progress on the product have made it a major disappointment, and it’s starting to look like a marketing gimmick more than a groundbreaking vehicle.

1. **Full Self-Driving Tech Overhyped** – Despite the constant chatter about robotaxis, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still stuck at Level 2-3. Other companies have already rolled out Level 4 autonomous vehicles, making Tesla’s claims look more like wishful thinking at this point.

1. **Political and Tariff Risks** – Tesla’s business is exposed to a number of external factors, from steel and aluminum tariffs to an anti-EV U.S. President. Plus, with a California governor who openly opposes Musk, there’s a real risk of losing state EV incentives, which would hurt sales.

1. **Raw Material Costs Are Rising** – Tesla is also facing increasing raw material costs, and tariffs on batteries imported from China could push those prices even higher. With profitability already under pressure, this is something that could really squeeze margins going forward.

1. **Struggling to Attract AI Talent** – Tesla’s ability to innovate in AI seems to be stalling. The company is having trouble attracting top AI talent, with many researchers opting to join OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies. This could set them back in the long run, especially as competitors accelerate their own AI developments.

1. **Losing Support from Left-Leaning Consumers** – Tesla’s alignment with Musk’s political views has alienated many left-leaning consumers, who are typically more inclined to purchase EVs. This shift in consumer sentiment could hurt Tesla’s market share, especially as alternatives to Tesla grow.

I used to think of Tesla as the Nvidia of EVs, miles ahead of everyone else. But right now, it feels like they’re slipping, with more and more companies closing the gap. Like probably lots of you (well, at least those on TikTok) I’ve been using the trademind AI a lot recently, and that also has TSLA as a clear red flag to sell now. With all these issues piling up, I really struggle to see how Tesla maintains its $1.1 trillion valuation.

2025-02-18,China May Delay Tesla Full Self-Driving Approval Amid Trade War In Latest Fallout From Musk-Trump Ties,"Tesla (TSLA) is girding itself for a possible delay in Chinese approval of its Full Self-Driving technology, amid the latest U.S.-China trade war, the Financial Times reported Monday, citing sources. That could leave Tesla at a disadvantage as China rivals such as BYD (BYDDF) make similar systems standard.

Chinese regulators have told the EV giant that ""there is no definitive timetable"" for approval. That would let Tesla begin training FSD in China.

Beijing is considering using Tesla's FSD license as a bargaining chip in trade talks with President Donald Trump.

On Feb. 1, Trump imposed a 10% tariff hike on Chinese goods, but has threatened more. China has retaliated, but with targeted tariffs as well as various export controls. Delaying a TSLA FSD license would be a way of applying pressure on Trump without being explicit.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a top Trump adviser, wielding significant government power.

In September, Tesla said it expected to roll out FSD in China during the first quarter of 2025, with that ambition later pushed back to Q2.

Tesla FSD Training 'Quandary'

An FSD license would only be the first step. Tesla would then need to train FSD in China, which has extra complications, as Musk noted on the Q4 earnings call last month.

""Then China, which is a gigantic market, we do have some challenges because they weren't — they currently don't allow us to transfer training video outside of China. And then the US government won't let us do training in China. So, we're in a bit of a bind there. It's like a quandary.""

China EV Rivals Offer Self-Driving Systems
Tesla has hoped for a burst of FSD sales and subscriptions from a China FSD launch.

But many China EV makers offer Level 2 systems that are at least equal to FSD, including XPeng (XPEV) and Huawei. XPeng says it aims to offer Level 3 self-driving, which lets the driver not pay attention under certain conditions and speeds.

On Feb. 10, EV giant BYD announced it was rolling out Level 2 systems across its EV lineup, even for the Seagull EV, which starts at less than $10,000. Notably, BYD isn't raising model prices for the ""God's Eye"" system.

So it's unclear how much Tesla might be able to charge for FSD in China, if anything. The system goes for $8,000 or $99 a month, in the U.S.

A lengthy delay for approval could leave Tesla at a disadvantage if China rivals have Level 2 systems standard.

Despite its name, FSD is a Level 2 driver-assist system. Musk says Tesla will launch unsupervised robotaxi rides in Austin starting this June, with many more cities to follow by year-end. But Musk has said ""this year"" or ""next year"" for true self-driving for nearly a decade.

Trump-Musk Ties A Tesla Negative?
Tesla stock spiked higher after Election Day, with investors betting that the EV giant would benefit in various ways from Elon Musk's close ties with Donald Trump. But Musk's high-profile role in the Trump administration appears to be further eroding the Tesla brand in the U.S. and Europe.

Now, Tesla may be seeing fallout from Trump tariffs. It's possible China could take more-explicit actions vs. Tesla if the trade war intensifies.

Tesla Stock

Tesla stock fell to 2025 lows last week before bouncing back somewhat. TSLA is of 11.9% this year and 27.2% from its Dec. 18 record high.

Meanwhile, BYD stock has skyrocketed 33.3% so far in February, hitting a record high.

XPeng stock is near recent 52-week highs, up almost 41% in 2025.

Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it’s an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines.

Tesla’s stock price continues to show volatility in early March trading, falling 0.9% in premarket activity after two days of gains. This follows Monday’s steep 15.4% drop that marked the company’s worst trading day in nearly five years.

The electric vehicle maker saw its shares rebound 7.6% on Wednesday and 3.8% on Tuesday. These gains came after President Donald Trump’s public commitment to purchase a Tesla Model S during a White House event with CEO Elon Musk.

Despite the recent uptick, Tesla stock remains down almost 50% from its mid-December record high. The current price hovers around $245.75 in premarket trading.",4269,491

2025-03-20,What's TSLA worth in a fire sale?,"Occasionally, I see people suggest TSLA could go to $0. Obviously, any company can go to $0 if it's mismanaged for long enough, so sure, TSLA could go to $0. But some people have explicitly claimed that TSLA is basically a dead man walking, and could go to $0 any day now. This seems wrong, and it's kind of become a pet peeve for me.  
  
But what's the right answer? What's TSLA worth if tomorrow Elon Musk has a psychotic break tomorrow and is filmed running naked through the National Mall, a la the Kony 2012 guy?

Tesla's [most recent annual financial statement](https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings) lists a ""stockholder's equity"" also known as book value, of $72.913 billion. Divide by 3.22 billion shares and you get the [reported of book value per share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/key-statistics/) $22.67. (My calculator says $22.64 but I assume that's a rounding error.)

That $72.913 billion book value comes from $122.070 billion in assets, including $58.360 billion in ""current assets"", less $48.390 billion in liabilities. Now according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_asset):

>In accounting, a current asset is an asset that can reasonably be expected to be sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the current fiscal year, operating cycle, or financial year. In simple terms, current assets are assets that are held for a short period.

If you look at the details of the balance sheet, the current assets are mostly stuff that would retain its value pretty well in a disaster, stuff like ""cash"" and ""short-term investments"". Strictly speaking if TSLA is holding a one-year bond its value on March 19th might be more or less than it was worth on December 31st, but assuming the value is unchanged isn't the worst assumption. The big exception, AFAICT, is ""inventory"", of which the balance sheet shows $12.017 billion.

Now, if you assume that when TMZ posts that naked Elon Musk video, all Tesla's inventory and all its non-current assets become worthless, yeah that bankrupts the company. But that's pretty clearly a bad assumption. The inventory might have to be marked down, but to $0? Maybe no hypothetical acquirer wants a Cybertruck factory, but factories can be retooled. Placing a market sell for Tesla's $1.076 billion worth of crypto might not return much cash, but presumably an acquirer wouldn't be that stupid. And I'm not an accountant, but ""deferred tax assets"" (valued at $6.524 billion) sound like something an acquirer might value at close to par?

So maybe we mark down Tesla's inventory by half (\~$6.009 billion); we mark down its crypto, which is overwhelmingly Bitcoin, based on how much Bitcoin has declined since December 31st (\~$0.078 billion), and we mark down other non-current assets (excepting deferred tax assets) by half (\~$28.133 billion), which gives us a fire sale value of about $38.69 billion or about $12/share.

I'm a software engineer, not an accountant or investment banker, so someone with more expertise in fundamentals analysis than I could probably come up with a better estimate than $12/share. But the fact remains you probably shouldn't place any bets that depend on TSLA going to $0 by end of next week.

Even though, yeah, fuck Elon.

Anyway, here's my position, which I'm holding today's movement be damned:

Today, the Financial Times has released a new report pointing to a $1.4 billion gap in assets:

2025-03-21,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

2025-03-21,Exclusive-Tesla trade-ins on pace for record high amid Musk backlash,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Motorists have traded in a record number of Tesla (TSLA) electric vehicles this month, Edmunds data showed, amid a wave of protests against CEO Elon Musk's work as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Tesla cars from model year 2017 or newer accounted for 1.4% of all the vehicles traded in until March 15, up from 0.4% in March last year, according to data provided to Reuters by Edmunds. Analysts at the national car shopping website said that share could grow through the second half of the month.

In February, the Trump administration's first full month, Teslas made up 1.2% of vehicles traded in.

March's trade-ins so far would be the highest monthly share Edmunds has on record of Tesla trade-ins toward new or used purchases at dealerships, if the trend continues. This excludes trade-ins toward new purchases of Teslas and EVs from other direct-to-consumer brands.

Musk is leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency and activists across the U.S. have staged so-called Tesla Takedown demonstrations over his role in cuts to the federal workforce and cancellation of contracts that fund global humanitarian programs.

Social media has been rife with posts from Tesla owners in the U.S. and some European countries showing them giving up their vehicles in displays of anger toward Musk.

The March data on Tesla trade-ins has not been previously reported.

""Brand loyalty is becoming a bigger question mark as factors such as Elon Musk's increasing public involvement in government, Tesla depreciation concerns and its increased saturation in major metro areas leave some longtime owners feeling disconnected from the brand,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.

Spokespersons for Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tesla has said it expects the vehicle business to return to growth this year, after a small drop in 2024.

Prices of used Teslas have dropped in line with other EVs from Ford, Kia and Hyundai, according to Edmunds.

Used Tesla prices will likely decline further as Tesla trade-ins that are undergoing reconditioning reach the market, Edmunds analysts said.

Anger against the brand has resulted in Tesla vehicles being set on fire and damage to the company's showrooms and charging stations.

Trump has said he would label such attacks as domestic terrorism.

Tesla stock, which skyrocketed since Trump's election in November on hopes it would be easier for the company to roll out robotaxis under the new administration, has nearly halved from its January peak.

Fred McKinney, a corporate consultant, traded in his 2018 Tesla Model 3 last month to show his disapproval of Musk.

""I thought about putting a bumper sticker on my car saying, 'I hate Musk.' But selling the car feels so much better,"" he said on a LinkedIn post. ""If you are considering a new EV, under no circumstances consider buying a Tesla.""

Data from Edmunds also showed shoppers' consideration of new Teslas dropped to 1.8% last month - the lowest level since October 2022 - after peaking at 3.3% in November.

Tesla's sales likely fell 10% in February, hurt by declines in its Cybertruck pickup, Model 3 sedan, and Model Y SUV, separate estimates from market research firm Cox Automotive showed on Thursday.

""These shifts in Tesla consumer sentiment could create an opportunity for legacy automakers and EV startups to gain ground,"" Caldwell said.

""As Tesla brand loyalty and interest waver, those offering competitive pricing, new technology, or simply less controversy could capture defecting Tesla owners and first-time EV buyers.""

Ives stuck to his outperform rating on the stock, but said the future of the EV maker depends on a major change of course from Musk.

Ives has long been a bull on Tesla, holding the highest stock price target among Wall Street analysts at $550. That implies a 133% upside to Wednesday’s closing price of $235.86.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

BYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK), [BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV), [9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.

BEV sales at Geely ([0175.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/0175.HK), [GELYF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GELYF)) -owned Volvo and SAIC ([600104.SS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/600104.SS))-owned MG, instead, dropped by 30% and 67% respectively, the data showed.

Total car sales in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland dropped by 3% to 0.97 million in February, while BEV registrations were up by 25%.",4205,302
2025-03-26,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

In some countries like Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands, they are down by aprox 60-70% in March 2025 compared to last year  (March 2024), even after Model Y changeover has finished.

In Norway, Tesla is once again the best seller, but it's still down by around 20% from March 2024, and the Q1 total is down around 30%.

There is currently no supply shortage, since you can order a new Model Y Juniper and get delivery almost the same day. The source for the numbers were taken from this website: [https://eu-evs.com/](https://eu-evs.com/)

One country had an increase in sales 25% (Spain).

Overall for the countries listed it was down est around 36%.

2025-03-29,Institutions fade Tesla,"Analyzing Tesla's (TSLA) ownership structure reveals a significant shift over the past two years, with institutional ownership decreasing from approximately 66.2% in March 2023 to around 47.5% by March 2025. This decline suggests a notable reduction in holdings by actively managed institutional investors.

Institutional Ownership Breakdown:

Total Institutional Holdings: As of March 2025, institutional investors hold about 47.5% of Tesla's outstanding shares.

Active vs. Passive Investments:While specific data distinguishing between active and passive institutional holdings is limited, major shareholders like Vanguard Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. are known for managing both index-tracking funds and actively managed portfolios. The substantial decrease in overall institutional ownership indicates that actively managed funds have likely reduced their positions in Tesla.

Key Institutional Shareholders:

Vanguard Group Inc.: Holding approximately 6.79% of Tesla's shares, Vanguard manages a mix of passive index funds and active investment strategies.

BlackRock Inc.: Another significant shareholder, BlackRock holds a considerable stake through various funds, including those that passively track indices.

Conclusion:

The marked decline in Tesla's institutional ownership over the past two years suggests that actively managed institutional investors have reduced their exposure to the company. While passive index funds continue to hold Tesla shares to mirror their benchmarks, the overall reduction points toward strategic decisions by active managers to decrease their positions. Monitoring future institutional filings and ownership reports will provide further insights into these evolving investment patterns.",192,33

2025-03-31,Challenging the Noise: A Closer Look at Tesla's Q1 Projections,"As we have all seen, there are a ton of headlines about Tesla's (TSLA) declining sales numbers, and it's honestly a bit overwhelming. Here's a quick breakdown of what I gathered:

* Europe sales are reportedly down by 45%
* China sales have decreased by either 49% or 29%
* Australia sales are down by 65.5%

\^\^ keep in mind there are a ton of articles and headlines on this, I picked from a few \^\^

With all these headlines, it's tough to figure out what timeframes they're talking about. Is it one day, one week, three months? Who knows?

Amidst all this noise, I decided to dig deeper into what we should actually expect. While analysts' projections aren't great, they don't seem as grim as the headlines suggest.

**Global Tesla Sales (Q1):**

* **2024 Actual**: 386,810 units
* **2025 Initial Projections**: 412,000 units (median of 398K-426K range, which would've been a 6.5% increase)
* **2025 Current Projections**: 377,000 units (a 2.5% decrease from Q1 2024)
* **Projection Change**: Initial to current projections dropped by 8.5%

**USA Sales Breakdown (Q1):**

* **2024 Actual**: 140,187 vehicles
* **2025 Current Projection**: 138,867 vehicles
* **Change**: Only a 0.9% decrease in the US market

These numbers don't look great, especially for a company like Tesla that's all about growth. But we're still talking about single-digit declines quarter-over-quarter, assuming the analysts are somewhat correct.

I wanted to understand what the Q1 report might reveal because, going by the headlines, it seemed like it would be terrible. But after digging in, it doesn't seem as bad as it feels. Is it just me?

What do you all think? Could the market react less harshly on Q1 review day than the news is making it out to be?",32,86

2025-04-02,"Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.","Before I jump into the stock related stuff, as an old, I feel it is important to preface this with a little cautionary advice. Here is my three points of ""don't be stupid"":

1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it.
2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod.
3. I deliberately waited for the ""Tesla Takedown"" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue.

If you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot!

First, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.

Hidey Hole-3: [https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh](https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh)

Obviously, my local dealer isn't selling enough cars to keep up with their deliveries (no surprise to anyone). But the big question I have is: Are these vehicles considered ""delivered""? Tomorrow Tesla reports how many vehicles they have ""delivered"" (not the same as sold). And if you haven't been paying attention as of late, Tesla has had some questionable practices going on in [Canada with their sales](https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/elon-musk-tesla-under-investigation-canada-wrongfully-boosting-sales/) and some possible questions raised about their accounting methods with the [$1.4 billion discrepancy](https://mashable.com/article/tesla-missing-billion-dollars) in their books. Going back a little further, there was a whistleblower that reported [Tesla deliberately messes](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html) with their delivery numbers to make it appear as if they are selling more new cars than they really are.

Point being, no matter what is reported tomorrow, I am not going to believe the numbers Tesla provides. If there are new Teslas being shoved into an obscure parking lot in my city, it has to be happening elsewhere. At some point, I suspect the vehicle overflow will get noticed in other places too. Has anyone else found a Tesla hidey hole?

Most importantly, even if the number suck tomorrow, I doubt it will make that much of a difference in the stock price because of the ERDF. What is the ERDF you ask? It is the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF). And this incredibly powerful field effect is really all that matters when it comes to anything ""Elon"". It's real. And people should acknowledge it as such or risk their own peril. Nothing logical or sane applies to Elon Musk and it never has.

Edit/Update: Despite missing on deliveries, $TSLA is not really down that much. Everything is being affected from the tariff news so any impact isn't really noticeable. And the sales miss is being explained away by the Model Y refresh, as widely expected and foretold by just about every media outlet covering Tesla. No surprises in the ERDF holding $TSLA strong despite the bad news.

But not Elon. In fact, just the opposite occurred. He became, and remains to be, the richest man on Earth. This displays the tremendous power of the ERDF- It is nothing like the world has ever seen. Even more powerful than [Jewish Space Lasers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html).

The ERDF is by far and away Elon's greatest invention and achievement. If there are two things Elon should get tremendous credit for, it is knowing when to invest in the right things and building hype around them. The guy is a six-dimensional hype machine from outer space with uncanny prescience. From PayPal to SpaceX, he saw where future opportunity was being underinvested in and took it over. When it comes to Tesla, he even knew when to make it ""not a car company"". Using the power of the ERDF, he made it an AI, self-driving vehicle, taxi, and humanoid robot company just in the nick of time before sales of their actual product fell off a cliff. This company is now known as ""Tessler"". Now, it doesn't matter if they sell any cars at all. Elon is using the ERDF to sell the future and even control the presidency. And it's working. It sounds crazy as hell but we are all watching this happen in real life.

Amazingly, the ERDF has allowed Elon to stall indefinitely on all promises of delivering the future and show absolutely no meaningful results for over a half-decade. Nor is Tesla a first mover in any of their new initiatives. Waymo (Google) has already launched self-driving taxis that are available using Uber and even in buzzing around in Austin Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. The idea of humanoid robots has been around forever. And one behemoth of a car company already developed one. But that happened over a quarter century ago. The car company was Honda and the robot was called ASIMO. And nobody cared. They discontinued it in 2018. Elon's ""Optimus"" has only been seen to do preprogrammed demos that look like Boston Dynamics routines from the early 2000's (nobody cares about them either). They have also been spotted shuffling around like Joe Biden. Neither the Robotaxi or Optimus robot are anywhere close to being released. And I have strong doubts as to what utility, if any, the Optimus robot will have for anybody. All of this seems to be a distraction created by the ERDF to draw attention away from the fact that Tesla still hasn't achieved ""full"" self-driving (and [ignored LIDAR sensors](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/17/lidar-vs-cameras-a-giant-fail-for-tesla/)). I am expecting Elon to come out with a ""Fred Flintstone"" sedan next, with no floor that you power with your feet, and telling everyone that it will be the future of travel. If Elon says it, then it ""Musk"" be true (the guy has a name that just keeps on giving).

With no first-mover advantage in the driverless taxi space, being behind tech giant Google there, and reviving an old failed sci-fi robot idea from their much larger and more established competitor in Honda, you would think Tesla would get graded down for unoriginality. But nope. The ERDF kicks in yet again and [most analysts are bullish](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-dives-as-another-bullish-analyst-worries-about-deliveries-5e90f869) and astonishingly, Cathy Wood, seemingly most affected by the ERDF (and other things that make people stupid), thinks Tesla stock is going to reach an astounding [$2,600 in five short years](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-reaffirms-tesla-2-212612251.html)! That's about 10x more valuable than it is today, giving Tesla a market cap somewhere around $8.5 trillion dollars. That would make Tesla more valuable than all the other major auto manufacturers, Uber, Lyft, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, combined in today's market (with a trillion to spare). Does that sound realistic? You can call me a skeptic of Cathy Wood...

Again, make no mistake, the ERDF is real. And if we are talking straight stock price, it matters. It might be the only thing that matters. Love him or hate him, it seems that Elon and his ERDF manufactured the most successful ad campaign in history right on the lawn of the White House. But it wasn't for the cars. It was for the stock. All the new people getting sucked into the ERDF because of Elon's new found bromance with Trump have no idea of what has been happening with Elon prior to his involvement in politics. And they don't care. They just know him as ""Tech Support"" guy and Trump's new ally. They love Trump and there is no shortage of them. They might be willing to wait another 5-years for Cathy's insane prediction to come true, not knowing everyone else had already been waiting for 5-years before them. Fresh meat so-to-speak. Tesla's 10-day average volume is over 138 million shares. And most of this is [retail traders going bonkers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true) for Tesla and Elon. It is likely that Elon has masterfully used his ERDF to transition retail stock holders from younger, tech savvy and/or environmentally conscious investors to straight up Fox News Dads in less than one quarter.

While it has already been noted on this sub that institutional investors are likely pumping $TSLA to orchestrate a soft landing for themselves (on the backs of retail investors), I don't think they can exit too quickly without causing a complete fiasco. They only have to report 30-days after each quarter ends and they trade in dark pools. So, we plebeians won't know what the big institutional holders are doing until after they have done it (unless they report sooner). And if any one big institutional investor dumps their position fast enough to spook the market, there will certainly be consequences. Both political and financial. The finances between Elon, his many ventures, and his personal loans must be a complete nightmare of both complexity and scale. While in theory Elon could be ""margin called"" for his loans that have Tesla stock put up as collateral for, I am not so sure it would happen even if the stock drops significantly. The banks just went through a crisis of confidence with the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse. If something triggered Elon's house of cards to collapse, it could have larger implications for his lenders and they might take a lot of heat for it. And the banks certainly don't want to invite in more oversight. They might just eat the loss and hold the shares in hopes they eventually regain their value. For that reason alone, I think the chances of Elon getting margin called are slim. But I would definitely be keeping an eye on the institutional holders once they report at the end of this month to see if there are any notable changes.

Edit/Update: A few hours after posting this, it was reported that [Swedish firm Folksam](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-its-tesla-shareholding-2025-04-02/) closed their entire position in Tesla. While not nearly as big as other institutional holders, it was still about $160M worth of stock. That's not chump change. (Mods: Sorry for originally using a Seeking Alpha article in the link- I didn't know they were blacklisted). 

To end this manifesto post, and give the shorts a little glimmer of hope, I offer one possibility that has not really been talked about all that much. Despite the massive power of the ERDF, some people do indeed escape it. And despite all the hype around AI, robots, and automation, Elon's companies are still run by the most unpredictable machines on the planet- humans. Tesla's long time CFO and potential successor for Elon, Zachary Kirkhorn, left suddenly in the [summer of 2023](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cfo-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down-replaced-by-vaibhav-taneja-2023-08-07/). Four more of Elon's top executives and direct reports left in [short order in 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loses-4-top-executives-ahead-of-robotaxi-event-2024-10). Baglino sold off his [$180 million in shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/former-tesla-svp-drew-baglino-is-selling-181point5-million-worth-of-stock.html) when he left. Not much of a vote of confidence there. And Tesla as a whole recently [fired a massive number of employees](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/tesla-started-laying-off-14000-employees-it-couldnt-have-gone-worse.html). From the reports, Elon seemingly did it in the same smug and indifferent manner in which he fired people at Twitter and is currently doing in the federal government.

Ultimately, if people become disenfranchised and are no longer willing to do Elon's bidding, his enterprises will fail. And there is only so much you can pay people to motivate them before you lose profitability. To make a Star Wars analogy, the only way I see to bring down the ERDF that protects and surrounds Elon's seemingly unstoppable Death Star, is if people on the inside of his operations lose faith in him and get tired of his bullshit. All the people around Elon: His loyal followers on X and even president Trump to some extent, don't do anything for him but build his ego and amplify the strength of the ERDF. But none of them know how to design and build cars or launch space shuttles. That's a very small group of very intelligent people that cannot be replaced as easily as retail investors. It's the smart people on the inside that make all of Elon's visions come into reality. In the end, I think the human element might be Elon's undoing.",227,120
2025-04-02,"Tesla reports 336,000 vehicle deliveries in first quarter","Tesla reported 336,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2025, two days after the electric vehicle company’s stock wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022.

Here are the key numbers:

* Total deliveries Q1 2025: 336,000
* Total production Q1 2025: 362,000

Investors were expecting Tesla to report deliveries of between 360,000 and 370,000 vehicles, according to StreetAccount. Tesla’s investor relations team sends a company-compiled consensus to select analysts, and said the average estimate was for around 377,590 deliveries. Prediction market company Kalshi on Tuesday released a forecast for Tesla deliveries of 352,000.

In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla reported 386,810 deliveries, and production of 433,371 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.

Tesla doesn’t break out sales and production by model or region. However, the company said that it produced 345,454 of its most popular Model 3 and Model Y cars and delivered 323,800 of them in the three months ending March 31.

The company reported 12,881 deliveries of its other models, including its angular steel Cybertruck.

During the quarter, Tesla faced planned, partial shutdowns in some of its factories that allowed the company to upgrade manufacturing lines to start producing a redesigned version of its popular Model Y SUV.

CEO Elon Musk recently said during an all-hands session with Tesla employees that he expects the Model Y to be the “best-selling car on Earth again this year.” 

But Tesla has to contend with an onslaught of EV competition and reputational damage. In the first quarter, the company was hit with waves of protests, boycotts and some criminal activity that targeted Tesla vehicles and facilities in response to Musk’s political rhetoric and his work as part of President Donald Trump’s second administration.

After spending $290 million to help return President Donald Trump to the White House, Musk is leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he’s slashing costs, eliminating regulations and cutting tens of thousands of federal jobs.

Musk, the world’s wealthiest person, has also involved himself in European politics, promoting the anti-immigrant AfD party in Germany in February’s elections. Tesla’s business on the continent is struggling.

Across 15 European countries, Tesla’s market share declined to 17.9% in the first quarter from 9.3% in the same period a year earlier, according to data tracked by EU-EVs.com. In Germany, Tesla’s market share in battery electric vehicles plummeted to 4% from about 16% over that stretch.

Tesla shares sank 36% in the first quarter, their steepest drop since the fourth quarter of 2022 and third-biggest decline in the company 15 years on the public market. The drop wiped out $460 billion in market cap.

2025-04-03,"Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.","Before I jump into the stock related stuff, as an old, I feel it is important to preface this with a little cautionary advice. Here is my three points of ""don't be stupid"":

1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it.
2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod.
3. I deliberately waited for the ""Tesla Takedown"" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue.

If you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot!

First, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.

Hidey Hole-3: [https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh](https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh)

Obviously, my local dealer isn't selling enough cars to keep up with their deliveries (no surprise to anyone). But the big question I have is: Are these vehicles considered ""delivered""? Tomorrow Tesla reports how many vehicles they have ""delivered"" (not the same as sold). And if you haven't been paying attention as of late, Tesla has had some questionable practices going on in [Canada with their sales](https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/elon-musk-tesla-under-investigation-canada-wrongfully-boosting-sales/) and some possible questions raised about their accounting methods with the [$1.4 billion discrepancy](https://mashable.com/article/tesla-missing-billion-dollars) in their books. Going back a little further, there was a whistleblower that reported [Tesla deliberately messes](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html) with their delivery numbers to make it appear as if they are selling more new cars than they really are.

Point being, no matter what is reported tomorrow, I am not going to believe the numbers Tesla provides. If there are new Teslas being shoved into an obscure parking lot in my city, it has to be happening elsewhere. At some point, I suspect the vehicle overflow will get noticed in other places too. Has anyone else found a Tesla hidey hole?

Most importantly, even if the number suck tomorrow, I doubt it will make that much of a difference in the stock price because of the ERDF. What is the ERDF you ask? It is the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF). And this incredibly powerful field effect is really all that matters when it comes to anything ""Elon"". It's real. And people should acknowledge it as such or risk their own peril. Nothing logical or sane applies to Elon Musk and it never has.

Edit/Update: Despite missing on deliveries, $TSLA is not really down that much. Everything is being affected from the tariff news so any impact isn't really noticeable. And the sales miss is being explained away by the Model Y refresh, as widely expected and foretold by just about every media outlet covering Tesla. No surprises in the ERDF holding $TSLA strong despite the bad news.

But not Elon. In fact, just the opposite occurred. He became, and remains to be, the richest man on Earth. This displays the tremendous power of the ERDF- It is nothing like the world has ever seen. Even more powerful than [Jewish Space Lasers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html).

The ERDF is by far and away Elon's greatest invention and achievement. If there are two things Elon should get tremendous credit for, it is knowing when to invest in the right things and building hype around them. The guy is a six-dimensional hype machine from outer space with uncanny prescience. From PayPal to SpaceX, he saw where future opportunity was being underinvested in and took it over. When it comes to Tesla, he even knew when to make it ""not a car company"". Using the power of the ERDF, he made it an AI, self-driving vehicle, taxi, and humanoid robot company just in the nick of time before sales of their actual product fell off a cliff. This company is now known as ""Tessler"". Now, it doesn't matter if they sell any cars at all. Elon is using the ERDF to sell the future and even control the presidency. And it's working. It sounds crazy as hell but we are all watching this happen in real life.

Amazingly, the ERDF has allowed Elon to stall indefinitely on all promises of delivering the future and show absolutely no meaningful results for over a half-decade. Nor is Tesla a first mover in any of their new initiatives. Waymo (Google) has already launched self-driving taxis that are available using Uber and even in buzzing around in Austin Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. The idea of humanoid robots has been around forever. And one behemoth of a car company already developed one. But that happened over a quarter century ago. The car company was Honda and the robot was called ASIMO. And nobody cared. They discontinued it in 2018. Elon's ""Optimus"" has only been seen to do preprogrammed demos that look like Boston Dynamics routines from the early 2000's (nobody cares about them either). They have also been spotted shuffling around like Joe Biden. Neither the Robotaxi or Optimus robot are anywhere close to being released. And I have strong doubts as to what utility, if any, the Optimus robot will have for anybody. All of this seems to be a distraction created by the ERDF to draw attention away from the fact that Tesla still hasn't achieved ""full"" self-driving (and [ignored LIDAR sensors](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/17/lidar-vs-cameras-a-giant-fail-for-tesla/)). I am expecting Elon to come out with a ""Fred Flintstone"" sedan next, with no floor that you power with your feet, and telling everyone that it will be the future of travel. If Elon says it, then it ""Musk"" be true (the guy has a name that just keeps on giving).

With no first-mover advantage in the driverless taxi space, being behind tech giant Google there, and reviving an old failed sci-fi robot idea from their much larger and more established competitor in Honda, you would think Tesla would get graded down for unoriginality. But nope. The ERDF kicks in yet again and [most analysts are bullish](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-dives-as-another-bullish-analyst-worries-about-deliveries-5e90f869) and astonishingly, Cathy Wood, seemingly most affected by the ERDF (and other things that make people stupid), thinks Tesla stock is going to reach an astounding [$2,600 in five short years](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-reaffirms-tesla-2-212612251.html)! That's about 10x more valuable than it is today, giving Tesla a market cap somewhere around $8.5 trillion dollars. That would make Tesla more valuable than all the other major auto manufacturers, Uber, Lyft, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, combined in today's market (with a trillion to spare). Does that sound realistic? You can call me a skeptic of Cathy Wood...

Again, make no mistake, the ERDF is real. And if we are talking straight stock price, it matters. It might be the only thing that matters. Love him or hate him, it seems that Elon and his ERDF manufactured the most successful ad campaign in history right on the lawn of the White House. But it wasn't for the cars. It was for the stock. All the new people getting sucked into the ERDF because of Elon's new found bromance with Trump have no idea of what has been happening with Elon prior to his involvement in politics. And they don't care. They just know him as ""Tech Support"" guy and Trump's new ally. They love Trump and there is no shortage of them. They might be willing to wait another 5-years for Cathy's insane prediction to come true, not knowing everyone else had already been waiting for 5-years before them. Fresh meat so-to-speak. Tesla's 10-day average volume is over 138 million shares. And most of this is [retail traders going bonkers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true) for Tesla and Elon. It is likely that Elon has masterfully used his ERDF to transition retail stock holders from younger, tech savvy and/or environmentally conscious investors to straight up Fox News Dads in less than one quarter.

While it has already been noted on this sub that institutional investors are likely pumping $TSLA to orchestrate a soft landing for themselves (on the backs of retail investors), I don't think they can exit too quickly without causing a complete fiasco. They only have to report 30-days after each quarter ends and they trade in dark pools. So, we plebeians won't know what the big institutional holders are doing until after they have done it (unless they report sooner). And if any one big institutional investor dumps their position fast enough to spook the market, there will certainly be consequences. Both political and financial. The finances between Elon, his many ventures, and his personal loans must be a complete nightmare of both complexity and scale. While in theory Elon could be ""margin called"" for his loans that have Tesla stock put up as collateral for, I am not so sure it would happen even if the stock drops significantly. The banks just went through a crisis of confidence with the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse. If something triggered Elon's house of cards to collapse, it could have larger implications for his lenders and they might take a lot of heat for it. And the banks certainly don't want to invite in more oversight. They might just eat the loss and hold the shares in hopes they eventually regain their value. For that reason alone, I think the chances of Elon getting margin called are slim. But I would definitely be keeping an eye on the institutional holders once they report at the end of this month to see if there are any notable changes.

Edit/Update: A few hours after posting this, it was reported that [Swedish firm Folksam](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-its-tesla-shareholding-2025-04-02/) closed their entire position in Tesla. While not nearly as big as other institutional holders, it was still about $160M worth of stock. That's not chump change. (Mods: Sorry for originally using a Seeking Alpha article in the link- I didn't know they were blacklisted). 

To end this manifesto post, and give the shorts a little glimmer of hope, I offer one possibility that has not really been talked about all that much. Despite the massive power of the ERDF, some people do indeed escape it. And despite all the hype around AI, robots, and automation, Elon's companies are still run by the most unpredictable machines on the planet- humans. Tesla's long time CFO and potential successor for Elon, Zachary Kirkhorn, left suddenly in the [summer of 2023](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cfo-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down-replaced-by-vaibhav-taneja-2023-08-07/). Four more of Elon's top executives and direct reports left in [short order in 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loses-4-top-executives-ahead-of-robotaxi-event-2024-10). Baglino sold off his [$180 million in shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/former-tesla-svp-drew-baglino-is-selling-181point5-million-worth-of-stock.html) when he left. Not much of a vote of confidence there. And Tesla as a whole recently [fired a massive number of employees](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/tesla-started-laying-off-14000-employees-it-couldnt-have-gone-worse.html). From the reports, Elon seemingly did it in the same smug and indifferent manner in which he fired people at Twitter and is currently doing in the federal government.

Ultimately, if people become disenfranchised and are no longer willing to do Elon's bidding, his enterprises will fail. And there is only so much you can pay people to motivate them before you lose profitability. To make a Star Wars analogy, the only way I see to bring down the ERDF that protects and surrounds Elon's seemingly unstoppable Death Star, is if people on the inside of his operations lose faith in him and get tired of his bullshit.

2025-04-06,Why TSLA is a buy.,"**Intro**

Okay, so Telsa has had not the greatest of starts to the year. With the stock being down something like 50% from the top.

But sometimes one just needs to take a step back and remember what is going on at Tesla and why it will make the stock pop off.

**The Cyberbeast**

Tesla now has a killer truck on the market. Sharp, angular, fast and just absolutely kills. Sure, it's had a couple of recalls (8) but that's just normal for all new cars on the market.

**Not just a car company**

One thing to remember about Tesla is that it's not just a car company it's also a bet on taxis. You know that thing you use like once or twice a year. Man I wish Tesla was a taxi company. Then we could be valued like Waymo or Uber and not like a boring car company.

Oh, and Tesla also does these robots that are really cool. That definitely are 100% AI* (actually interns). I think there is this other company called boston dynamics also doing robots and they where sold to Hyundai for 1.1 billion dollars. Now that's a lot of money.

**Valuation**

Man, Teslas current valuation just sucks. I just don't see why people aren't more hype about the company. The P/E is a modest 117, a couple of weeks ago it was closer to 200. But I guess it's fine. The other MAG 7 are like in their 30s.

**Brand**

On a more positive note, Teslas brand image is on fire. Like, literally. And people are just going to want to se it becoming brighter now with Elon Musk work at DOGE.

**Conclusion**

At the end of the day, you just have to zoom out. Way out. Like, to a level where fundamentals, earnings, and reality don’t really matter. And when you do that? Then it all just makes perfect sense.

But sometimes one just needs to take a step back and remember what is going on at Tesla and why it will make the stock pop off.

**The Cyberbeast**

Tesla now has a killer truck on the market. Sharp, angular, fast and just absolutely kills. Sure, it's had a couple of recalls (8) but that's just normal for all new cars on the market.

**Not just a car company**

One thing to remember about Tesla is that it's not just a car company it's also a bet on taxis. You know that thing you use like once or twice a year. Man I wish Tesla was a taxi company. Then we could be valued like Waymo or Uber and not like a boring car company.

Oh, and Tesla also does these robots that are really cool. That definitely are 100% AI* (actually interns). I think there is this other company called boston dynamics also doing robots and they where sold to Hyundai for 1.1 billion dollars. Now that's a lot of money.

**Valuation**

Man, Teslas current valuation just sucks. I just don't see why people aren't more hype about the company. The P/E is a modest 117, a couple of weeks ago it was closer to 200. But I guess it's fine. The other MAG 7 are like in their 30s.

**Brand**

On a more positive note, Teslas brand image is on fire. Like, literally. And people are just going to want to se it becoming brighter now with Elon Musk work at DOGE.

**Conclusion**

At the end of the day, you just have to zoom out. Way out. Like, to a level where fundamentals, earnings, and reality don’t really matter. And when you do that? Then it all just makes perfect sense.

2025-04-10,"Accounting Departures and Undelivered Promises (Tesla can't win, it's over)","I saw the article [here](https://electrek.co/2025/04/09/tesla-top-financial-controller-leaves-tsla/) regarding the director of accounting controllership, Harsh Rungta. This is right before earnings (April 22nd, 2025).

>Rungta was responsible for all corporate accounting, including SEC filings and revenue recognition policy.

In that article, there's this comment:

>Fred, here is something you should investigate. I worked many years for a company that provided wireless services as part of their business offering, and when you provide a service with an up-front payment, GAAP states that you cannot recognize this revenue until the service is actually provided. In the limited reports I have seen, Tesla began recognizing some accrued FSD revenue last year, not the full amount but a portion of it. IMHO, this is a very shady practice because Tesla has not yet deployed FSD, at least in the definition of what they sold it as. I suspect this is why they changed the name to Unsupervised FSD to enable them to start this revenue recognition. I don't know the details of composite, but if they are including this in their revenue numbers, it should be broken out somewhere in their quarterly reports.

>If I were the CFO of Tesla, I would not allow any accrued FSD revenue to be recognized, because it doesn't follow GAAP and no sane accountant would agree they have delivered what they promised.

>Somebody needs to dig deeper into this and call them out over it. Especially if they have recognized this revenue on HW3 customers, because Elon is on record stating it won't be deployed on that HW platform.

>Could you be the investigative journalist that calls them out over it?

GAAP has a requirement that you [""only recognize individual transaction prices as revenue when the corresponding obligations of a given exchange are fulfilled--typically meaning that the product was delivered or the service was performed. Whether or not a specific invoice has been paid does not factor into revenue recognition.""](https://www.invoiced.com/resources/blog/revenue-recognition-principle#:~:text=Since%20ASC%20606%20aligns%20with,or%20the%20service%20was%20performed) You are allowed to partially recognize revenue as you deliver parts of the feature, but you still need to eventually deliver on the feature itself. Otherwise that ""deferred revenue"" is actually just stolen money.

So the Chief Accounting Officer leaves and we have a gray zone in accounting based on what FSD actually means. The gray zone isn't some big secret, [it's been talked about for a while](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1cdncw9/comment/l1dn22g/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

But that's not all, David Lau, the lead for software engineering at TSLA is also leaving after 12 years in the role. ""Lau led a team at Tesla that was responsible for software in Tesla’s electric vehicles."" That's odd. Right before they're meant to deliver on the biggest feature in the history of the company he leaves?

But TSLA also has a contract to build Robotaxi. How are they going to fulfill that if they don't even have FSD yet? In fact, in the permits they got with California:

>The permit is a prerequisite for applying to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service in California, but a CPUC spokesperson said the current permit ""does not authorize them to provide rides"" in autonomous vehicles, and does not allow Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to the public.

In Austin:

>If the plan comes to fruition, it will mark the debut of Tesla's unsupervised Full Self-Driving software; currently, only FSD (Supervised) is available. Musk said the unsupervised version could be available on customer cars as early as next year...

Now they're getting government contracts based on the promise of FSD? This time the ""unsupervised"" one, Elon swears it's for real this time.

But even if he's successful in creating FSD, are all the people who bought the beta on older hardware going to be told they don't actually get FSD because of hardware limitations? That's not deferred revenue. It's undeliverable revenue. It was: 1) incorrectly recognized as revenue; and 2) remains a huge liability.

Tesla is caught in a massive catch-22.

EDIT (more potential issues):

Another huge implication of this is that there've been reports of Tesla owners updating their software, that software then breaking the functionality of their car, then when they go in to get their vehicle serviced, they're charged for it. That is fraud. If vehicle owners go in with Hardware 3.0, and the fix for for the issue is Hardware 4.0 but the shop charges $2,000 for it, they're now charging you more for something you already paid for.

There was a report recently that Tesla has a missing $1.5 billion on their balance sheet. Is that the money that they needed for hardware upgrades? If so, how much is the Hardware 3.0 to 4.0 going to cost Tesla? Elon seems to think (against his shareholders) that 4.0 is necessary for FSD. Possibly David Lau knew this too. Given the inherent risk in putting killing machines on roads with hardware that just isn't fast enough, he quit. This is speculation.",376,47

2025-04-12,Tesla just hit a big trade war roadblock in China,"As Beijing retaliated — again — against President Donald Trump’s tariff hikes, Tesla (TSLA) quietly pulled options to buy new Model S and X electric vehicles from its website in China, several outlets reported Friday.

Tesla builds both of these models in the U.S., which makes them subject to China’s newly announced 125% tariffs on U.S. imports; Beijing’s announcement came in response to the Trump administration’s decision to boost effective import taxes on goods from China to 145%.

The escalating tariffs form yet another roadblock for Tesla. Its year-over-year sales in China were already down 11.5% in March, even with a lift from the debut of the company’s revamped Model Y, as competitors (including BYD (BYDDY)) gained significant ground.

On the upside, Tesla has a factory in Shanghai that makes its Model Y and 3 vehicles, both of which are more popular in China than the S and X, per Bloomberg.

Tesla is also struggling to compete in Europe; in January, as CEO Elon Musk’s role in the second Trump administration grew clear, Tesla’s sales cratered 44%, according to one third-party report. A subsequent report found that Tesla’s sales in Europe dropped again in February. Despite Musk’s close ties with Trump, the billionaire CEO has criticized U.S. tariffs on Europe, where Tesla faces increasing competition from Chinese and European EVs alike.

Things haven’t looked so hot in the U.S., either. A new Kelley Blue Book report concluded that Tesla’s sales in the U.S. declined “nearly 9%” year-over-year in the first quarter of 2025, while overall EV sales in the U.S. grew 11%. The report added: “Without a significant shift in product strategy, Tesla will continue to shrink in the U.S. market.”

Tesla was down about 1% as of 3:15 p.m. ET on Friday. Since January 1, the stock has tanked about 34%.

2025-04-13,"Tesla's Stock Is Set For A ""Death Cross"" On Monday","Tesla's 50-day moving average is about to cross the 200-day, a bearish signal. Meanwhile, vehicle sales are slumping, while the valuation remains high.

Tesla Inc. investors need to ask themselves: How do you price in sentiment?

Chief Executive Elon Musk's involvement in Washington and his leadership role in the so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, have been driving the narrative lately on Tesla's stock $(TSLA)$ - for better or worse.

The stock rallied in the final quarter of 2024, running up by 120% between late October and mid-December, partly on a strong sales outlook and partly because of Musk's closeness to President Donald Trump. Investors hoped his ties to the administration would be positive for Tesla.

Now, though, those ties have become a liability for the electric-vehicle maker. People are vandalizing Tesla dealerships, charging stations and cars driven by its customers. Even those who aren't actively boycotting the brand may be deterred from owning a Tesla right now.

The company is heavily consumer-facing. About 77% of its revenue comes from consumer vehicles, and Tesla also sells energy products to consumers. So brand sentiment and its impact on sales matters. The truth is, very few high-profile brands have seen backlash and political boycotts to the degree Tesla is now experiencing.

Bud Light serves as one example, but to a lesser extent. Following an April 2023 boycott of Bud Light, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA's (BE:ABI) stock tumbled by about 16% in a little over a month. Sales for Bud Light haven't recovered. So gauging the fallout from backlash against Tesla ahead of its future earnings could be difficult.

Bob Lang, founder and chief strategist at Explosive Options, suggests turning to soft data to try and determine how consumers feel about the brand. A survey by YouGov from March showed that 37% of respondents said that Musk is either part of or wholly the reason they wouldn't consider owning or leasing a Tesla.

2025-04-15,How bad is this for TSLA?,"Tesla is facing significant pressure to address a major shortfall in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.
Approximately 4 million vehicles equipped with the Hardware 3 (HW3) computer- installed in Teslas produced from April 2019 through late 2023-are unable to achieve the promised unsupervised autonomous driving capabilities. This revelation contradicts Tesla's earlier assurances that all vehicles produced since 2016 had ""all the hardware necessary for full self-driving capability.""

In January 2025, CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that HW3 lacks the necessary processing power for full autonomy. He stated that Tesla would need to upgrade the computers in vehicles of customers who purchased the FSD package. This admission has sparked discussions about potential compensation or hardware upgrades for affected owners.

The situation is further complicated by (HW4) computers. In early 2025, Tesla recalled over 200,000 vehicles due to HW4 units short-circuiting, leading to failures in safety features like rearview cameras. The company is addressing these problems through over-the-air software updates and, when necessary, hardware replacements.

Given the scale of the HW3 issue and the costs associated with potential retrofits or compensation, this could become one of the most expensive recalls in automotive history. Tesla has not yet detailed a comprehensive plan for addressing the HW3 limitations across its fleet.

2025-04-23,Tesla Earnings: Two predictions and what to watch for after.,"Position: I am short on Tesla.

Apparently, Elon is going to talk today: [Elon Musk breaks his own Tesla (TSLA) earnings rule in desperate move](https://electrek.co/2025/04/21/elon-musk-breaks-tesla-tsla-earnings-rule-desperate-move/)

We all know what this is about: Building hype to distract from the endless onslaught of bad news for Tesla. Elon is going to deploy his ERDF (Elon Reality Distortion Field) to pump up his meme stock. This comes as no surprise to anyone here. 

Prediction #1: Taking the likely prediction from the Tesla bulls, Elon will tell investors the same old story of Tesla becoming ""not-a-car-company"" anymore and to completely ignore all of 2025. (Source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2025-largely-doesnt-matter-tesla-113124531.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2025-largely-doesnt-matter-tesla-113124531.html) ). Also, not really a big stretch of the imagination here. 

Prediction #2: Just for fun, I will make a very specific prediction of how Elon will use his ERDF to dazzle the mouth breathers into dumping more money into his meme stock. I expect that he will roll out the Optimus. It will do the following tasks, in order:

1. Perform some silly preprogrammed maneuver that makes it look like it is self-aware. It will look at it's hands or something similar to make it look like it has ""intelligence"" and ""awareness"". Just watch the dumb video they have already put out there.
2. Elon will throw a bunch of small, non-fragile, objects out on a flat surface and say: ""*Now watch this!*"". 
3. The robot will quickly grab each small object, maybe something like a domino, and arrange them quickly in an ordered fashion. It might even flick the first one to knock down the chain. 
4. Controlled remotely by a human off stage, the robot will wave goodbye to a choreographed verbal prompt from Elon and then walk off the stage. Maybe it will even do a little dance for us. 
5. The bleating sheep will go nuts and the stock will pop. 
6. End sham demo. 
7. Begin hand-waving and tech-jargon spewing to explain away endless mounting problems for Tesla. 

I predict this because of Elon's long history of stage-hyped vaporware demos. This will be really easy for him to pull off because they can just rip a few sensors and software out of the common pick-and-place robots already used in their production lines and quickly cobble them into the Optimus. It is going to look just like the pre-canned routines production robots run at manufacturing trade shows but for dimwits that have never been to one and think this is all ""new"" technology. 

Most importantly: This will gloss over the inconvenient fact that any ""brand damage"" Elon has caused Tesla, will also surely impact the sales of any other consumer product they will launch in the future. For example, an obscenely expensive robot that will likely be unable to scramble an egg for you. 

The whole ""Tesla is not-a-car-company anymore"" earnings (so ignore the lack of earnings) show will also gloss over the fact that, like everything else ""new"" at Tesla, it is an old idea and they are way behind the competition (e.g., Waymo/Google in the Robotaxi space). The idea of a car company making humanoid robots was first put out there by Honda with ASIMO over a quarter century ago. They developed it. There was no consumer market for it. So, they repurposed it. There still isn't a consumer market here (longer discussion). And there is already a second generation of advanced humanoid robots for manufacturing from a company called [Figure building BMW's in Spartanburg, SC](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/news/general/2024/humanoid-robots.html). Let's also just ignore all the more advanced humanoid robots coming out of China just like we are told to ignore BYD that just surpassed Tesla without even having access to the US market. If Elon says it's the future, it ""Musk"" be true, and Tesla will somehow be the ***only*** company in the world doing it. 

Will Tesla's stock pop today? Probably. But who really knows with any meme stock. Performance and numbers haven't mattered at all in the past for Tesla. Retail investors are just a herd of bleating sheep that will easily get caught up in the ERDF. What I am going to be looking for is 45 days from the end of Q1 when the data from the 13F Forms comes out. Watching what the big institutional investors are doing will really be telling. I strongly suspect, given previous reports of retail investors buying up [Tesla like never before](https://www.investopedia.com/why-teslas-stock-soars-despite-car-sales-numbers-11705040), that the institutional investors are going to slowly reduce their positions in Tesla and orchastate themselves a nice soft landing on the backs of gullible retail investors. Given that institutional investors hold about half the company, I predict that this news is what will really drive the stock price for the foreseeable future. ",211,82
2025-04-23,Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Tesla reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.” The company said this “dynamic,” and “changing political sentiment” could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products.

Tesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany’s far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the company reported a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681.

Tesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by Alphabet’s Waymo. The company has promised to launch its first driverless ride-hailing offering in Austin, Texas, in June.

The company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a “pilot launch” in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year.

Operating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline.

The company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year.

Energy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is “creating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.”

Tesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said “increasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.”

2025-04-23,Tesla stock up on terrible numbers as usual.,"reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

Earnings per share: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
Revenue: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated
Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Earlier this month, Tesla reported a 13% decline in deliveries to 336,681. Tesla blamed the lower deliveries, in part, on the need to suspend production temporarily at its factories while it upgraded lines to start manufacturing a refreshed version of its popular Model Y electric SUVs.

This is breaking news. Please check back for updates.

2025-04-23,Tesla reports 20% Q1 drop in auto revenue,"Brutal numbers from Tesla after the bell. 

As we all know, their stock performance is often decoupled from results. Little movement in futures so far, but curious how it’ll move tomorrow. 

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

…

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

2025-04-24,Tesla (TSLA) stock surges on Elon's lies despite disastrous earnings,,910,173
2025-04-25,No evidence that Tesla is a retail memestock?: bad math inside,"I've gotten really interested in Tesla stock price volatility and the theory that there's something unusual holding up the price. How could Tesla report Z- earnings and still go up 10%? The usual answer is that it's a [memestock](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsla-become-meme-stock-top-141112636.html) bloated by retail investors. These gormless retail investors, entranced by promises of Mars, cannot stop stupidly shoveling their lower-middle class dollars into Musk's eager hands.

This doesn't sound quite right to me, and the articles I found on touting high retail ownership were sparse on details. But if it were true that this was the cause of Tesla's high valuation and volatility, you would expect Tesla to have an unusually high retail ownership percentage and a disproportionate amount of retail dollars compared to the rest of the mag7. And as far as I can tell, it just doesn't.

*Method:* I'm not a stock analyst, so I don't know the best way to do this. There's probably an easier and more accurate method, but I compared the insider ownership percentage from fintel with the institutional ownership percentage from NASDAQ (no idea how accurate those are). I did this for all of the mag7 and a few more speculative stocks for comparison: Palantir, BBAI, RGTI (quantum computing) and, of course, Gamestop. I then assumed the balance was retail (and maybe that's wrong). For the mag7, I calculated the dollar value of retail(?) ownership by looking at percentage of market cap.

**Results:** My results indicate that while TSLA has the highest potential retail ownership of mag7 at 38%, it's only higher than AAPL by about 1.5%. TSLA actually has the second lowest amount of overall retail dollars invested (317m), beaten only by META (234m), which has extremely high institutional ownership.

Interestingly, TSLA has lower retail ownership than Palantir (40.89%) and far, far lower than the other meme stocks, which hover in the 60-67% retail range.

**Discussion:** This is all wonky and will hopefully prompt someone else to do a similar analysis. But if it's even partly correct, then Tesla looks like a heavily manipulated stock designed to look like a memestock in order to cover up price manipulation. You could vaporize all retail TSLA holding and the company would still be valued at .5 billion. Apple isn't far off in retail percentage and it doesn't see anywhere close to this kind of extreme valuation or volatility.

Edit: sorry for bad formatting, I can't post the excel. First number is Insider %, second is institutional, third is those combined, and fourth is possible retail %.

2025-04-26,SPY and TSLA Flows Look Strong - But Something Feels Off Under the Hood,"Not trying to be a doomer, but after watching the action into close today, it’s hard to shake the feeling that something doesn’t add up:

SPY dark pool inflow was heavy, yeah, but the majority of the late prints were at bid, not ask. That’s smart money selling into strength, not loading for continuation.

TSLA was heavily distributed at the top, despite the media pump. Price action stayed glued to gamma walls, no real organic movement past resistance.

VIX dropped but didn’t collapse, which is weird. If this rally was legit, VIX should've flushed much harder. Holding above 23 tells me big players are still hedged.

After-hours was ""calm"", but a little too calm. No meaningful momentum, no real follow through.


It’s hard to call tops, I’m not claiming to. But between the sell-side dark pool flow, the late-day bid prints, and VIX refusing to die, I’m definitely raising an eyebrow.

Just my two cents.
Make sure you have a plan, not just hopium.

2025-04-26,So how does the lowered regulation for autonomous vehicles actually help Tesla achieve a profitable autonomous taxi service?,"Ok. So what I learned finally after scouring every article out there is this.  Under new AV rules:

1-reporting standard for AV involved crashes will be lowered NOT eliminated; I guess that saves Tesla a few buck every month.
2-AV vehicles can be built with less hardware (mirrors, brakes) since they don’t need a driver.  I guess we can lower the cost of the car a bit. 

So how does this warrant a 10% price move today on TSLA after prior days move after a horrible earnings report?  Did everyone see “less regulation” titles and assume that all of a sudden Tesla cars would be driving themselves, because it was the previous regulations that was stopping Tesla from having an actual autonomous car deployed?

2025-04-28,Used Tesla Prices Are Plunging. Is This the Final Nail in the Coffin for TSLA Stock?,"Problems for Tesla (TSLA) continue to mount amid tariff uncertainty and brand backlash over CEO Elon Musk’s political role. Protests targeting Tesla showrooms have dented its image, and Q1 results, hurt by a sharp drop in sales, fell below expectations.

The stock did rally about 5% after Musk said he would step back from the Department of Government Efficiency to give more attention to the EV maker. Yet underlying issues persist. Recent data from used-car listings show Tesla’s resale values plunged double-digits in March, far steeper than any other brand. The Model S led with a 17.2% year-over-year drop, followed by the Model Y at 13.1%, the Model 3 at 10.9%, and the Model X down 7.3%.

This collapse in used-car prices highlights deeper troubles with tariff uncertainty choking off China’s demand, brand damage from political protests, and disappointing earnings. 

Is this plunge in used-Tesla prices the final nail in TSLA’s coffin, or a buying opportunity before a rebound? Let’s discuss.",1626,265
2025-04-28,Volkswagen Overtakes Tesla in European EV Market for the First Time,"Volkswagen has officially surpassed Tesla in electric vehicle (EV) sales across Europe during the first quarter of 2025, marking a significant shift in the region’s fast-evolving EV landscape. The German automaker achieved a strong performance with three models ranking among the top ten best-selling battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

**Europe’s EV Market Sees Record-Breaking Quarter**

March 2025 became the second-best month on record for EV registrations in Europe, with 240,891 new BEVs hitting the roads — a 23% increase compared to March 2024. Electric vehicles accounted for 17% of the total market share, meaning nearly one in five new cars registered was electric.

While the figure still falls short of the all-time high of 275,108 BEVs registered in December 2022, it contributed to making Q1 2025 the most successful quarter for BEV sales in European history.

**Tesla’s Decline Despite Model Y Juniper Launch**

Despite launching the updated Model Y Juniper, Tesla continued to struggle with declining sales. According to data from JATO Dynamics, Tesla retained its title as the top-selling BEV brand in March 2025, although its registrations dropped 30% year-over-year.

That said, the monthly decline was less severe compared to the drops in January (-47%) and February (-44%), offering a slight silver lining for the U.S. automaker.

**Volkswagen Takes the Lead**

Tesla’s downward trend led to its fall to second place in the quarterly rankings, with 53,237 BEVs registered — a 38% year-on-year decrease. In contrast, Volkswagen posted a 157% surge, registering 65,679 units and claiming the top spot.

BMW also showed strong momentum, selling 46,557 BEVs — a 21% increase — while Audi and Renault rounded out the top five with 34,739 (+51%) and 31,880 (+89%) units sold, respectively.

2025-04-29,Is PLTR or TSLA a Better Position for AI Growth???,"I want to increase AI exposure in my portoflio because I am really bullish on AI for the future. Im debating between PLTR and TSLA. I feel like TSLA has so much potential in the AI space with their fully autonomous taxi service that allows Tesla owners to make money with their cars, however, waymo is a strong competitor here. The other TSLA project im pretty bullish about is their AI robots. The ceo of Nvidia recently said that they believe autonomous robots are the next stage of the AI boom. I think there is a lot of potential here if companies can adopt them to save money with more manual work.

My biggest worry with Tesla is the controversy surrounding it. Tesla's name has been completely destroyed internationally. BYD was already beating them by a lot but now its going to be bad. I also am a bit worried that the CEO will continue to do more to destroy the Tesla name through other shocking actions.

2025-05-13,List of reasons why Tesla can't deploy self-driving cars,"Folks were commenting earlier today about how unlikely it is that Tesla could deploy anything like a self-driving car next month. So I did a deeper dive and collated some of the many reasons. It may not be a surprise to long time Musk observers, but I was shocked by the difference between what Tesla presents publicly, what the press leaves unchallenged, and objective reality. If I missed anything, please let me know.

Edit: To the people thinking that Musk/Trump will blunt regulatory blowback, that's probably somewhat correct. But the initial problem is that, as Tesla admits, there is nothing to regulate. They just don't have the tech. Getting into real regulation issues would be progress for Tesla.

Edit 2: To clarify, what I'm saying is that Tesla has, as far as I can tell, never ever written in an SEC filing that it has anything remotely resembling the autonomous driving capability it is also supposed to unveil next month. Ever. End of story. Any press articles to the contrary are built on PR fluff and vague Musk promises. I'm not talking about technical feasibility alone, I don't know anything meaningful there (but I believe people saying Musk is wrong). Just that Tesla also acknowledges not having self-driving cars. 

1. *Tesla's 2024 annual report admitted that the company only has supervised driving capabilities, not self-driving*. Unlike Waymo and other competitors with Level 4 SAE (pretty much full autonomous driving), Tesla admits that its full self driving (FSD) requires human supervision, putting it at Level 2 SAE. So there's no way it will have a fleet of self-driving cars in Austin next month. There will be a driver. It admits that it intends to *eventually* have self-driving vehicles but doesn't say when. From page 3 of its [2024 Annual report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm):

""Currently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) options. Although at present, same as in the past, *the driver is responsible for remaining fully engaged in the driving operation*, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that can relieve drivers of many tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle systems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air software updates. In 2025, we intend to begin launching our Robotaxi business, a ride-hailing network that will *eventually* operate fully autonomous vehicles.""

Tesla didn't. Instead, it cited as a highlight for the 2024 year having made ""\[f\]urther improvements and deployment of our FSD (Supervised) capabilities."" Page 6.

3. Unlike its direct competitors ([list here](https://www.nhtsa.gov/automated-driving-systems/voluntary-safety-self-assessment)), *Tesla has never filed a Voluntary Safety Self-Assessment* (VSSA) describing the safety features of their level 3-5 autonomous driving system. A VSSA is voluntary, so it's possible to have autonomous driving technology but not have filed a VSSA. But it wouldn't make much sense given that a VSSA provide public proof of concept and helps assuage regulator concerns. And there are a lot of regulator concerns.

4. Even if they had full self-driving technology, *Tesla can't yet legally field cybercabs/robotaxis/whatever they are called*. Their cybercab doesn't have a steering wheel or pedals. So it needs to be granted an [FMVSS Exemption](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204794/tesla-robotaxi-elon-musk-earnings-fmvss-steering-wheel) before it can be on the road. That typically takes 6-12 months after filing. And Tesla hasn't filed. And even if it had, the exemptions are capped at 2,500 per company.

5. Before deploying any self-driving car (should one exist), Tesla must respond to the May 8, 2025 NHSTA letter demanding explanation of its FSD system. Among other things, [that letter](https://www.scribd.com/document/860730440/INIM-PE24031-62887#from_embed) requires Tesla to admit, by June 19, what level of SAE it actually has, how it works, and a slate of technical data. Deploying a new system without satisfying NHSTA risks enforcement actions and won't help Tesla's case when a car runs over another person.

6. Even at its current level, Tesla FSD has been [under investigation](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2022/INCR-EA22002-14496.pdf) for years.

Edit 2: To clarify, what I'm saying is that Tesla has, as far as I can tell, never ever written in an SEC filing that it has anything remotely resembling the autonomous driving capability it is also supposed to unveil next month. Ever. End of story. Any press articles to the contrary are built on PR fluff and vague Musk promises. I'm not talking about technical feasibility alone, I don't know anything meaningful there (but I believe people saying Musk is wrong). Just that Tesla also acknowledges not having self-driving cars. 

1. *Tesla's 2024 annual report admitted that the company only has supervised driving capabilities, not self-driving*. Unlike Waymo and other competitors with Level 4 SAE (pretty much full autonomous driving), Tesla admits that its full self driving (FSD) requires human supervision, putting it at Level 2 SAE. So there's no way it will have a fleet of self-driving cars in Austin next month. There will be a driver. It admits that it intends to *eventually* have self-driving vehicles but doesn't say when. From page 3 of its [2024 Annual report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm):

""Currently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) options. Although at present, same as in the past, *the driver is responsible for remaining fully engaged in the driving operation*, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that can relieve drivers of many tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle systems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air software updates. In 2025, we intend to begin launching our Robotaxi business, a ride-hailing network that will *eventually* operate fully autonomous vehicles.""

2. *Two weeks ago, in* [its amendment to its 2024 annual report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000110465925042659/tm252787d2_10ka.htm)*, Tesla again admitted to only having Level 2 SAE.* This would have been a good time to tell everyone that yes, you have self-driving capabilities and will deploy them later this year. Tesla didn't. Instead, it cited as a highlight for the 2024 year having made ""\[f\]urther improvements and deployment of our FSD (Supervised) capabilities."" Page 6.

3. Unlike its direct competitors ([list here](https://www.nhtsa.gov/automated-driving-systems/voluntary-safety-self-assessment)), *Tesla has never filed a Voluntary Safety Self-Assessment* (VSSA) describing the safety features of their level 3-5 autonomous driving system. A VSSA is voluntary, so it's possible to have autonomous driving technology but not have filed a VSSA. But it wouldn't make much sense given that a VSSA provide public proof of concept and helps assuage regulator concerns. And there are a lot of regulator concerns.

4. Even if they had full self-driving technology, *Tesla can't yet legally field cybercabs/robotaxis/whatever they are called*. Their cybercab doesn't have a steering wheel or pedals. So it needs to be granted an [FMVSS Exemption](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204794/tesla-robotaxi-elon-musk-earnings-fmvss-steering-wheel) before it can be on the road. That typically takes 6-12 months after filing. And Tesla hasn't filed. And even if it had, the exemptions are capped at 2,500 per company.

5. Before deploying any self-driving car (should one exist), Tesla must respond to the May 8, 2025 NHSTA letter demanding explanation of its FSD system. Among other things, [that letter](https://www.scribd.com/document/860730440/INIM-PE24031-62887#from_embed) requires Tesla to admit, by June 19, what level of SAE it actually has, how it works, and a slate of technical data. Deploying a new system without satisfying NHSTA risks enforcement actions and won't help Tesla's case when a car runs over another person.

6. Even at its current level, Tesla FSD has been [under investigation](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2022/INCR-EA22002-14496.pdf) for years. I don't even understand all of this, and maybe DOGE can crush it. But even if it does, the possible liability from a malfunctioning FSD is enormous.",303,206

TLDR Excerpts:

\- ""Elon Musk previously stated repeatedly that the vehicles in the Robotaxi launch will be “unsupervised.” It seems likely that they will be remotely supervised, and possibly sometimes remotely driven. That would make Tesla’s demonstration much less impressive then depicted.""

\- ""Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas stated that Tesla said their Austin Robotaxi pilot will be “Invite Only. Plenty of tele-ops to ensure safety levels – we can’t screw up.” ""

\- ""... It will be invite only...It is unknown if those who ride will need to do an NDA...""

\- ""Some have speculated Musk is not telling the truth..."" (I had to add this one for laughs).

\- ""After promising that Robotaxis will be unsupervised, Tesla will probably state that they only meant that there will be no in-car supervision, so Tesla fans may not be disappointed. If there’s lots of remote driving, however, that’s a let-down because it’s not self driving, and not a product that really scales.""

In summary, avid Tesla fans and insiders will be able to get a remotely operated ride in Austin very soon. Basically, it's going to be 10 to 20 drone taxis with a driver sitting in the HQ. Most importantly, as the article says, Tesla fans will not be disappointed. I expect they will indeed go nuts.

2025-05-21,Tesla's New Self-Driving Ride-Hailing Service – A Game Changer?,"Hey everyone – just saw some big news. Elon Musk announced that Tesla (TSLA) is launching a self-driving ride-hailing service in Austin, TX. It’ll start with about 10 vehicles and scale up to 1,000 within a month. He also mentioned a goal of having 1 million fully autonomous vehicles in operation by the end of next year.

The service will be geo-fenced for safety and allow Tesla owners to rent out their autonomous cars, similar to Uber or Airbnb’s model.

TSLA stock jumped over 3.5% intraday on the news, while competitors like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) dipped 1–2%, showing how seriously the market is taking Tesla’s expansion into ride-hailing.

If you believe in the long-term potential of autonomous mobility and tech disruption, this might be a major growth driver for TSLA. Definitely something to keep an eye on.

2025-05-27,TSLA: Why I'm still bullish despite the EPS nosedive,"Been holding TSLA since 2021 and just watched their recent earnings with mixed feelings. While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.

My position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)

The Q1 earnings were objectively bad

EPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)

Factory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers

Automotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s

Musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call

Yet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:

The energy business is quietly becoming a monster

While everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.

Source: [https://knkresearchai.com/report/TSLA](https://knkresearchai.com/report/TSLA)

The robotaxi bet could pay off big

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Optimus robot could be the sleeper hit

The Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model. They're planning to have thousands of units in production by year-end, ramping to potentially a million units annually by 2030. Imagine having one of these handling household chores, elder care, or factory work. The addressable market is potentially enormous if they can deliver even half of what they're promising.

I've been wrong before, but...

I sold half my position in 2022 thinking the Twitter acquisition would tank Tesla. Cost me about $40K in potential gains when it rebounded. The lesson I learned was that betting against Tesla's long-term vision because of short-term issues has consistently been a losing strategy.

2025-05-28,TSLA: Why I'm still bullish despite the EPS nosedive,"Been holding TSLA since 2021 and just watched their recent earnings with mixed feelings. While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.

My position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)

The Q1 earnings were objectively bad

EPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)

Factory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers

Automotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s

Musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call

Yet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:

The energy business is quietly becoming a monster

While everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.

The robotaxi bet could pay off big

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Optimus robot could be the sleeper hit

The Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model. They're planning to have thousands of units in production by year-end, ramping to potentially a million units annually by 2030. Imagine having one of these handling household chores, elder care, or factory work. The addressable market is potentially enormous if they can deliver even half of what they're promising.

I've been wrong before, but...

I sold half my position in 2022 thinking the Twitter acquisition would tank Tesla. Cost me about $40K in potential gains when it rebounded. The lesson I learned was that betting against Tesla's long-term vision because of short-term issues has consistently been a losing strategy.

Tesla (TSLA) stock slumped again on Thursday as the fallout continued to emerge from the very public policy blowout between President Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL,"" Musk posted on X on Wednesday.

Musk added, ""If the massive deficit spending continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing else!""

The vocal criticism is irking Trump, the Wall Street Journal reported, with a senior official claiming that White House advisors were ""caught off guard"" by Musk's latest broadsides.

Tesla stock fell solidly on Wednesday and extended those losses in premarket trading on Thursday, down as much as 3%.

The comments come after the one-time leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) waded earnestly into the debate over the bill this week, angrily posting Tuesday that it was a ""disgusting abomination.""

""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,"" he said.

""Shame on those"" who voted for it in the House, Musk added.

Bloomberg reported that Musk may also be driven by the fact that the federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.

Musk's barrage comes as the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, and a Congressional Budget Office estimation of its impact on the deficit adds fuel to Musk's line of argument.

The nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.

The formerly Musk-led DOGE itself has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find, and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.

Musk's closeness to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for Tesla, given its business with SpaceX and NASA and the regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.

But demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing some Tesla owners to become alienated by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.

Tesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating 250,000 robotaxi trips per week.",1291,185

2025-06-23,$60K on TSLA Puts:  Why TSLA Will Be Down Big Next Few Weeks.,"In no particular order:

- Iran news completely overshadows the Robotaxi launch which was likely a sell-the-news event anyways.

- Weekend fake internet money prices point to a selloff in stocks.  TSLA highly correlated to fake internet money.

- TX senate vote and signature of Governor requiring all autonomous vehicles to get to Level autonomy in order to operate starting in September.  This is a huge precedent which now means TSLA robotaxis will take much longer to scale because each State will have its own autonomous driving thresholds and review periods.  Waymo will continue to expand faster than TSLA.

- Attention now shifts to July 22 earnings.  Sales are pretty much down YoY throughout most of the entire world.  Analyst downgrades are coming.  TSLA will likely lower full year guidance.

- I expect a class action lawsuit from disgruntled HW3 owners soon because they are all realizing Elon lied about HW3 getting a free upgrade to HW4 and beyond.  It is clear now that HW3 vehicles wont ever have true FSD and the legal liability will be in the tens of billions of dollars.

- Elon is still popping off about one of Mango’s closest White House aides.  The probability of Elon pissing off Mango again is not insignificant.

- $7,500 EV Tax Credit likely expires at the end of this year.

- Oil spike likely means Fed delays rate cuts further.  High P/E stocks like TSLA generally suffer more in higher rate environments especially if economic growth is also slowing.

2025-06-24,Tesla Robotaxi goes live  stock rockets TSLA will continue to rise   or is it going cold?,"Fellow TSLA observers, checking in  As you may have seen  Tesla made big news recently: self-driving cabs (Robotaxi) officially went live in Austin charging only $4.20 per order (yup  Musk is playing the game again) 

On June 23rd, Tesla launched a trial run of Robotaxi in Austin  Texas Pricing is $4.20 per order  and it still has a human safety officer sitting in the car  but it has already begun to pay for external operations News As soon as the news came out Tesla stock spiked 8-10% straight up in pre-market to close near $348-$350 for the day 

Is TSLA up or down?

So far: TSLA is still running high  shares around $349. 8%+ one-day spike after Robotaxi

Year-to-date: while cumulative year-to-date is still in the -7% to -14% range (depending on where you start)  shares have rallied 35-40% since Robotaxi news

Reasons for the rally: 

Significant inflection point: this is the first step in making real money from Autopilot  This is the first step for autonomous driving to start making real money  there are still safeties, but this is a major breakthrough 

Valuation: UBS raised their price target from $190 to $215 (though still cautious) Cathie Wood continues to be bullish as well 

Macro-help: the Fed has become more dovish, and the overall broader market is optimistic  which also gives room for the rally to continue



Will it continue to rise or will it be prototyped?

Has the positive sentiment been overdrawn? UBS thinks Robotaxi's upside may have factored in a \~$99 share price premium 

Regulatory risk: Texas has made it clear that licenses are required by September, and there have already been some fines for non-compliance 

Musk risk: public opinion swirls  protesters  and political pressures are all over the place Investors can easily get scared 

Valuation is still expensive: even if it's profitable now, TSLA is still trading at a valuation of 170x 2025 expected profits. It's already outrageous 

TSLA is currently trading around $349 with intraday volume of \~176 million shares The trading range of $323-$357.5 is approaching the technical pressure level of $360-$370 

In a nutshell: the launch of Robotaxi is indeed a big positive The stock has surged by about 8-10%  Currently oscillating at $349 but a lot of the good has already been reflected 

Long view: this is a real turning point  Revenue modeling, branding, voice, and execution are all perfect scores  If technology and regulation keep up  it could continue to fly

Short view: valuation is too high  public opinion is too risky, and policy is too unstable  so it's not uncommon for the market to sell the news at any time  so it's not uncommon to see the market go higher



Do you think Robotaxi is a real long term change or a short term hype?

Anyone planning to wait for a pullback ($320-330) before getting in? Or are you ready to dump at $360?",196,311

Year-to-date: while cumulative year-to-date is still in the -7% to -14% range (depending on where you start)  shares have rallied 35-40% since Robotaxi news

Reasons for the rally: 

Significant inflection point: this is the first step in making real money from Autopilot  This is the first step for autonomous driving to start making real money  there are still safeties, but this is a major breakthrough 

Valuation: UBS raised their price target from $190 to $215 (though still cautious) Cathie Wood continues to be bullish as well 

Macro-help: the Fed has become more dovish, and the overall broader market is optimistic  which also gives room for the rally to continue



Will it continue to rise or will it be prototyped?

Has the positive sentiment been overdrawn? UBS thinks Robotaxi's upside may have factored in a \~$99 share price premium 

Regulatory risk: Texas has made it clear that licenses are required by September, and there have already been some fines for non-compliance 

Musk risk: public opinion swirls  protesters  and political pressures are all over the place Investors can easily get scared 

Valuation is still expensive: even if it's profitable now, TSLA is still trading at a valuation of 170x 2025 expected profits. It's already outrageous 

TSLA is currently trading around $349 with intraday volume of \~176 million shares The trading range of $323-$357.5 is approaching the technical pressure level of $360-$370 

In a nutshell: the launch of Robotaxi is indeed a big positive The stock has surged by about 8-10%  Currently oscillating at $349 but a lot of the good has already been reflected 

Long view: this is a real turning point  Revenue modeling, branding, voice, and execution are all perfect scores  If technology and regulation keep up  it could continue to fly

Short view: valuation is too high  public opinion is too risky, and policy is too unstable  so it's not uncommon for the market to sell the news at any time  so it's not uncommon to see the market go higher



Do you think Robotaxi is a real long term change or a short term hype?

Anyone planning to wait for a pullback ($320-330) before getting in? Or are you ready to dump at $360?",196,311

2025-06-30,GLJ Research Predicts Brutal Crash of Over 90% in Tesla Stock,"Tesla [(TSLA)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla?utm_source=theglobeandmail.com&utm_medium=referral) stock has been riding a wave of optimism fueled by its robotaxi hype, but not everyone is buying the bullish narrative. Notably, GLJ Research is holding firm on its ultra-bearish outlook, maintaining the Street’s lowest price target of $19.05 on TSLA stock, implying over 90% downside from current levels. As most analysts raise their expectations around Tesla’s robotaxi debut, GLJ’s call stands out as a stark warning to investors riding the momentum.

# Is a 90% Crash Coming?

Analyst [Gordon Johnson](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/gordon-johnson?utm_source=theglobeandmail.com&utm_medium=referral), founder of GLJ Research, has reiterated his Sell rating on TSLA, citing multiple concerns tied to Tesla’s recent robotaxi launch. Despite the hype, the rollout was restricted to a select group of Tesla fans rather than being widely available, raising doubts about the technology’s maturity and potential for broader deployment.

Johnson further pointed to a range of operational flaws in Tesla’s robotaxi debut, including trouble making left turns, phantom braking, and driving on the wrong side of the road. Some vehicles reportedly ended rides in unsafe spots like intersections, disrupting traffic. These issues raised serious doubts about the reliability of Tesla’s self-driving tech and led Johnson to maintain his bearish rating on the stock.

Nonetheless, the robotaxi debut marks a pivotal milestone in Tesla’s transition from EV manufacturing to full-scale AI-driven mobility solutions. At the same time, [investor sentiment remains strong,](https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-stock-is-exploding-right-now-as-robo-taxi-hits-the-road?utm_source=theglobeandmail.com&utm_medium=referral) fueled by excitement around the company’s autonomous technology roadmap.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/qtmovulCSg

Although I didn’t foresee the absolutely regarded retail pump the day after the launch, I did what anyone with balls should do:

I increased my position even more.  My $60K put position is now a nearly $72K put position.  I cashed out of my July puts and loaded up on August puts.

Why did I do this?  One of my catalysts was that Elon would antagonize TACO again.  This has played out exactly as I expected and then some.  An “America Party” now means Elon is TACO’s enemy.  This is insanely bad for all of Elon’s companies, from TSLA to SpaceX to X.ai and everything else.

Now that Elon has gone nuclear, not only will equity values of all his companies plummet, but Elon will likely have to sell more TSLA shares to fund his new political party.

I expect a big payoff for my August puts now that TSLA is without any meaningful positive catalysts until after earnings on July 23 (at least).

Between now and then, more and more people will realize:

1.  How devastating the Big Beautiful Bill will be to TSLA’s 2026 cashflows with the $7,500 EV tax credit expiring and the seemingly instant death of regulatory credit sales.  TSLA may lose money on a FCF basis as early as next quarter but almost certainly in 2026.

2.  Elon and TACO are both loose cannons and can pop off at the mouth over a hurt ego at any moment.  Tweets trigger the algos.  THIS WILL BE A CONSTANT OVERHANG FOR TSLA GOING FORWARD.  Momentum will be very difficult to ignite now that Elon has pissed off most of America.

3.  The true launch of Robotaxi with no teleoperators/supervised drivers will take MUCH longer than most of the Cult followers think.  Each state (including TX) will have different bars for TSLA to clear in order to operate at scale.  Those bars just got higher with Elon starting The America Party.  Given that TSLA is only a Level 2 ADAS technology, there’s a lot of trial and error before they can operate at scale.  One accident and ensuing bad PR, will send the stock plummeting.

4.  Optimus won’t be a popular product (if ever) until TSLA can have the robots operating at much more human levels (movement, comprehension, performative actions, etc.).  The Asians are way ahead on robot technology, the same way they are now way ahead on EV manufacturing/quality.

For all those that say “believe it or not, just buy calls”, TSLA is now down ~17% YTD.  The S&P 500 is up 7% and even the pathetic Russell 2000 is up ~1% YTD.

So please, by all means, keep telling me I’m stupid and that I don’t know what I’m doing.   Keep buying your calls even though deep down you know you are just burning your money due to the fact you are in a CULT.

I’ll keep shorting every nonsensical rally that you regards trigger as TSLA continues its overall downward trend back towards 150-200.

The Dawn Project Urges Legislators To Ban Tesla Full Self-Driving Over Critical Safety Defects Published in New Report to Congress

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dawn-project-urges-legislators-ban-172100801.html

Today, The Dawn Project shared a report of its findings with legislators and key regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has numerous open investigations into Tesla Full Self-Driving. The report comes amid Tesla’s rollout of its “Robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, which has been plagued with safety critical errors such as the Robotaxis driving on the wrong side of the road, blocking intersections, and nearly colliding with other cars.

The Dawn Project recently held a live demonstration of its safety tests in Austin which proved that the latest publicly available version of Tesla Full Self-Driving will run down a child crossing the road while illegally blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing and stop sign extended.

2025-07-09,Elon Musk Called LiDAR Lame as Tesla Robotaxis Lag Behind Waymo & Volkswagen,"**Story Highlights**

Tesla is doubling down on its camera-only approach to self-driving cars. But rivals like Waymo and Volkswagen are gaining ground with LiDAR-equipped robotaxis. Elon Musk’s disdain for LiDAR has long been public—he once famously called it “a crutch” and “lame.” As a result, Tesla [TSLA +1.32% ▲ ](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla)decided to rely solely on cameras for autonomous driving, which have seen immense scrutiny. But with competitors like Waymo and Volkswagen ([**DE:VOW3**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/de:vow3/forecast)) [VWAGY +1.49% ▲ ](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/vwagy)embracing full sensor stacks and reporting smoother results, the performance gap is becoming harder to ignore.

**Tesla Bets on Vision. The Real-World Results Are Mixed**

Tesla’s robotaxi rollout in Austin is now underway. Built entirely on vision-based autonomy, Tesla’s vehicles avoid radar and LiDAR completely. The system depends on cameras, neural nets and immense data training to replicate human driving.

However, early rider footage tells a more sobering story. Tesla’s robotaxis have been shown struggling with unprotected left turns, getting confused by lane markings, and hesitating at complex intersections. Some engineers who have tested the vehicles say the system remains far from delivering Level 4 autonomy in real-world conditions.

The reason Tesla chose this route is simple: hardware cost. Omitting LiDAR brings down the price per vehicle, helping Tesla scale faster. But the trade-off in accuracy and safety is now being called into question.

**Waymo’s Sensor-Heavy Fleet Shows a Different Kind of Progress**

While Tesla strips sensors, Waymo embraces them. Its robotaxis are loaded with high-resolution LiDAR, radar and multiple cameras. This multilayered perception system gives Waymo vehicles an edge in complex environments, especially where camera-only vision might falter.

Waymo is currently operating fully driverless robotaxis in Phoenix and San Francisco. The vehicles navigate construction zones, pedestrians and cyclists without human intervention. More importantly, they are gaining regulatory trust and public confidence at a pace Tesla hasn’t yet matched.

This contrast is becoming a defining fault line in the robotaxi race.

**Volkswagen’s New Robotaxi Service Brings Europe into the Fight**

Volkswagen has now entered the arena with its own LiDAR-equipped robotaxi service, launching first in Hamburg. The company is working with Mobileye [MBLY +1.25% ▲ ](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mbly)to bring Level 4 autonomous capabilities to its all-electric ID. Buzz — a modern, all-electric reimagining of the classic VW microbus. 

Unlike Tesla, VW is building its system with regulatory buy-in and long-term infrastructure partnerships. The vehicles use a fusion of LiDAR, radar and vision sensors to deliver consistent performance across different road conditions. With Germany’s strong regulatory framework and public transportation culture, Volkswagen’s program could scale quickly.

The launch in Hamburg is seen as a model for how legacy automakers may gain ground through careful deployment and strict compliance.

**Tesla’s Minimalist Sensor Approach Faces Growing Investor Scrutiny**

Tesla’s lofty valuation continues to hinge on future expectations tied to its autonomous driving ambitions. In particular, Elon Musk has claimed that the rollout of robotaxi services could eventually add trillions of dollars to the company’s market cap.

But those ambitions remain largely aspirational. Tesla’s camera-only system is still in limited testing and has struggled to gain widespread regulatory approval or consumer trust. Meanwhile, LiDAR-based systems — like those used by Waymo and Volkswagen’s Mobileye-equipped vehicles — have gained traction precisely because they offer more reliable detection in complex environments.

That growing trust in sensor-heavy solutions is raising questions about whether Tesla’s bet on a camera-only path is technologically viable in the near term. Tesla’s success will depend on how robotaxi competitors rack up real-world mileage and city approvals. If they do it well, then Tesla risks falling behind — not just in deployment, but in the narrative of safety and readiness that increasingly drives investor confidence.

Tesla’s lofty valuation continues to hinge on future expectations tied to its autonomous driving ambitions. In particular, Elon Musk has claimed that the rollout of robotaxi services could eventually add trillions of dollars to the company’s market cap.

But those ambitions remain largely aspirational. Tesla’s camera-only system is still in limited testing and has struggled to gain widespread regulatory approval or consumer trust. Meanwhile, LiDAR-based systems — like those used by Waymo and Volkswagen’s Mobileye-equipped vehicles — have gained traction precisely because they offer more reliable detection in complex environments.

That growing trust in sensor-heavy solutions is raising questions about whether Tesla’s bet on a camera-only path is technologically viable in the near term. Tesla’s success will depend on how robotaxi competitors rack up real-world mileage and city approvals. If they do it well, then Tesla risks falling behind — not just in deployment, but in the narrative of safety and readiness that increasingly drives investor confidence.

2025-07-25,Tesla’s stock plunges 9% after another weak quarter for auto sales,"Tesla shares fell 9% Thursday after the company reported a second straight quarter of declining auto sales, and CEO Elon Musk told analysts that there could be a “few rough quarters” ahead due to the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits.

Musk’s EV maker reported a 16% decline in automotive revenue from a year earlier to $16.7 billion. Total revenue fell 12% to $22.5 billion from $25.5 billion a year earlier, missing the average analyst estimate of $22.74 billion, according to LSEG.

Tesla has been facing rising competition in key markets like China and Europe, especially from lower cost Chinese EV players. In early July, Tesla reported a 14% year-over-year slide in vehicle deliveries to 384,000 for the second quarter. 

And in Europe, Tesla’s new car registrations declined last month, according to data released Thursday from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.

Tesla shares have been hammered this year, with the stock down 25% in 2025, by far the worst performer among tech’s megacaps.

On Wednesday’s earnings call, Musk and CFO Vaibhav Taneja said that the “big beautiful bill” recently passed by Congress would affect Tesla’s business. The bill ends a federal $7,500 EV tax credit at the end of September.

Along with the struggles in Tesla’s core auto business, Musk’s own political activity has been in focus. 

The world’s richest person led President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), slashing the size of the federal government and regulatory agencies that oversee his companies. He also endorsed Germany’s extreme anti-immigrant AfD party.

In recent months, Musk and Trump have clashed over the president’s spending bill, and Musk recently said he’s forming his own political party.

Tesla investors have been eagerly waiting for the company to release a cheaper EV model to refresh the aging lineup and perhaps reinvigorate sales. Tesla management said it started limited production of the more affordable model in June and expects to ramp it up in the second half of the year.

Still, the outlook for the rest of the year remains murky as Tesla didn’t provide any official guidance, a departure from earlier this year, when the company said growth would return in 2025.

“Management initially guided for deliveries growth in 2025,” Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, said in a note on Wednesday. “We interpret no guidance as a signal that management is no longer forecasting volume growth. This aligns with our expectation for deliveries to decline in 2025.”

2025-09-25,YOLO: Loaded the Boat on Tesla Puts 🚀📉,"Boys, I went full ape on $TSLA puts. 💎🙌

Currently sitting on $390 strike 11/21 puts with enough contracts to make or break my entire existence. Average cost was higher, but I averaged down with more today at $17.80.

This stock has been pumping harder than Elon at an earnings call, but every rocket runs out of fuel. Earnings + macro + overextension = setup for a rug pull.

If Tesla slides under $400, I print. If it nukes back to $372–$361 breakeven, I’m sure retiring with my tendies.

If not? Well, I’ll be the next WSB legend who donated $100k+ to this casino. 🎰

Screenshots for proof (because otherwise it didn’t happen).

Send thoughts, prayers, memes, and crayons.

YOLO.
