2024-10-02,Challenge to find stocks matching 13 attributes of Peter Lynch,"I tried to find modern examples to each attribute mentioned in Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street. Then I thought this community could find better fits and have fun together. So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.

RECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically ""perfect company."" The dream attributes of such a company go as:

***It Sounds Dull—Or Even Better Ridiculous:***

Companies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.

My examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) & The Lovesac Company (LOVE)

***It Does Something Dull:***

Companies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.

My examples: Waste Management (WM) & Stepan Company (SCL)

***It Does Something Disagreeable:***

Businesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.

My Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)

***It’s a Spinoff:***

Corporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.

Found a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)

***The Institutions Don’t Own It, and The Analysts Don’t Follow It:***

Stocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These ""ignored"" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.

My examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) & Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)

***The Rumors Abound: It’s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***

Lynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.

My examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** & Boyd Gaming (BYD)

***There’s Something Depressing About It:***

Companies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.

My examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) & Matthews International Corporation (MATW)

***It’s a No-Growth Industry:***

Contrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.

My examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) & American Water Works (AWK)

***It’s Got a Niche:***

A strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits

My examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) & WD-40 Company (WDFC)

***People Have to Keep Buying It:***

Lynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.

My examples: Procter & Gamble (PG) & Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)

***It's a User of Technology:***

Companies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.

My examples: Walmart (WMT) & Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)

***The Insiders are Buyers:***

Insider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.

My examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) & Carnival Corporation (CCL)

***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***

Companies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.

2024-10-10,100% in Berkshire Hathaway?,"Hi,

I am a US/UK dual citizen living in the UK.

I won’t get into the detail of the tax complications this causes, but essentially I am only able to invest in US or UK single stocks (not funds) from an international brokerage account in order to avoid very high taxation.

In this case, would my best investment bet for a simple ETF-like portfolio be 100% in Berkshire Hathaway?",0,58
2024-10-10,Berkshire Hathaway raises $1.9 billion in Samurai bonds,"[The News](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/berkshire-hathaway-raises-19-billion-samurai-bonds-term-sheet-shows-4669951)

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has raised **281.8 billion yen ($1.9 billion) in a seven-tranche yen-denominated bond deal**, its largest sale in the Japanese currency in five years, a term sheet reviewed by Reuters on Thursday showed.

The yen bond issue signals Buffett's deepening association with Japan's capital markets after its equity stake buys in the nation's top-5 trading houses over the past four years.

The U.S. investment company issued bonds with tenors of 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 28 and 30 years, according to the term sheet.

The 3-year tranche was the largest with 155.4 billion yen raised. The 5-year bond raised 58 billion yen.

Longer-dated bonds were added during the transaction and a proposed 15-year tranche was dropped, messages sent from the deal's bookrunners showed.

Final prices for each of the tranches were set at the lower to middle end of the revised price guidance given to investors, term sheets showed.

The deal was the largest yen-denominated bond issuance for Berkshire Hathaway since 2019 when it first issued yen, or Samurai, bonds

Berkshire Hathaway said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that the proceeds raised in the deal would be used for general corporate purposes. It did not disclose the size of the deal in the filing.

The firm first announced it would buy stakes in Japan's trading houses in 2020 with the intention of holding them long-term and increasing ownership to as much as 9.9 per cent. Since then, it has raised its stake in Japan's top five trading firms to around 9 per cent each, according to its annual report dated Feb. 24.

It sold 263.3 billion yen of bonds in April.

""Berkshire's yen bond sales this year is the biggest in a year since it started selling yen bonds and this indicates their expectations for upside of Japanese stocks,” said Takehiko Masuzawa, trading head of Phillip Securities Japan.

""The market is looking at what kind of stocks will be their next target. Investors see value stocks which pay higher dividends, such as banks and insurers, will be the most likely targets.""

2024-10-13,"One Day, Warren Buffett will Sack Elon Musk from Tesla","Berkshire Hathaway is currently sitting on a quarter of a trillion of cash. Warren has been adding to this by selling Bank of America.

What's he gonna buy?

Tesla is the limping Wildebeast at the edge of the herd, in my opinion. I suspect they've been comitting accounting fraud, have too many non-core projects draining cash, and will need a cash bail-out.

I think Berkshire will buy a large stake, remove Musk, sell off or cancel the AI, FSD, Robotaxi, teslavan, teslatruck obsessions, and develop the affordable car that Elon has been refusing to make. With a steering wheel.

2024-10-25,Expectations for Berkshire pre-election,"Recently Berkshire Hathaway has seen a pull-back from its ATH of 725,000(484 for Brk.B). Although a pullback is always expected when a stock price explores to a new high, but a breakdown lower is highly unlikely and is not what I expect to see heading up to election day. Their earnings are 11/2, 3 days before election. Berkshire has never seen volatility like it has recently and that will play a huge factor in is price action. The company's core assets reside in sectors such as insurance, energy, and consumer goods. Recently they sliced their holding of $AAPL in half, reducing their position to only 2.6% of the outstanding shares. Even  after concluding their sales $AAPL remains Berkshires largest holding at roughly 30% of their portfolio. Furthermore, their cash balance sits at a whopping $277 billion. This is my analysis of Berkshire Hathaway and why I think they will see upside heading towards election, what are your guys thoughts?",4,3
2024-10-26,Berkshire Hathaway as proxy cash holding?,"Disclaimer: I don't hold any BRK at this time (because I own A LOT of Apple).

* BRK.B is 983B USD, out of which, 277B USD is cash 
* That's \~70% in solid business and \~30% in cash.
* Cash grows \~5% per year.

Let's assume BRK stock holdings drop by 10% in a given year.

* BRK 10% drop in the stock holdings is 7% of their total holdings.
   * adjusted drop 7%.
* BRK cash grows \~5% per year, which is 1.5% of their total holdings.
   * adjusted drop 5.5%.
* BRK gets \~5B USD in dividends every year, which is 0.5% of their total holdings: adjusted drop 5%

Now, with a loss of 5%, BRK maybe realize some losses in order to offset capital gains, which would bring the actual loss even lower, let's say it drops another 0.5%, which makes the loss 4.5%.

Now, if BRK's holdings drop 4.5% and let's say you need to take 30% of the money from it:  
\- Now, BRK will buy more of their holdings.  
\- In order to recover the 4.5% of the 30% of the original money you've taken, the stock only needs to recover \~7% (which is not a lot, considering it just dropped 10%).

* That's \~70% in solid business and \~30% in cash.
* Cash grows \~5% per year.

Let's assume BRK stock holdings drop by 10% in a given year.

* BRK 10% drop in the stock holdings is 7% of their total holdings.
   * adjusted drop 7%.
* BRK cash grows \~5% per year, which is 1.5% of their total holdings.
   * adjusted drop 5.5%.
* BRK gets \~5B USD in dividends every year, which is 0.5% of their total holdings: adjusted drop 5%

Now, with a loss of 5%, BRK maybe realize some losses in order to offset capital gains, which would bring the actual loss even lower, let's say it drops another 0.5%, which makes the loss 4.5%.

Now, if BRK's holdings drop 4.5% and let's say you need to take 30% of the money from it:  
\- Now, BRK will buy more of their holdings.  
\- In order to recover the 4.5% of the 30% of the original money you've taken, the stock only needs to recover \~7% (which is not a lot, considering it just dropped 10%).

2024-11-01,Trimming Appl before Berkshire results tomorrow ,"Investors may want to consider trimming their Apple (AAPL) positions based on recent developments and upcoming events. Here's why:

## Apple's Recent Performance

Apple's latest earnings report has raised some concerns among investors. The company reported a decline in global iPhone sales for the second consecutive quarter, partly due to increased competition in China from companies like Huawei[3]. This slowdown in Apple's flagship product could signal challenges ahead for the tech giant.

## Berkshire Hathaway's Significant Reduction

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) has made a notable move by cutting its stake in Apple by nearly 50% during the second quarter of 2024[1][2]. This reduction came after Berkshire had already trimmed its Apple holdings by 13% in the first quarter[1]. Such a significant divestment by a long-term, value-focused investor like Buffett could be interpreted as a cautionary signal.

## Potential for Further Trimming

With Berkshire Hathaway set to report earnings tomorrow, investors should pay close attention. Apple's stock price has risen by approximately $15 since the end of September when Berkshire made its substantial cut. This increase, coupled with Berkshire's recent selling pattern, suggests that another trim in Berkshire's Apple holdings is possible[4].

## Broader Market Considerations

Berkshire's actions may reflect broader concerns about the U.S. economy. The company has increased its cash reserves to a record $277 billion, which could indicate a more cautious outlook on equities in general[5]. This substantial cash position might be seen as a hedge against potential market volatility or economic uncertainty.

## Investor Takeaway

While Apple remains a strong company with significant market presence, these factors combined suggest that investors might want to reassess their positions:

1. Apple's slowing iPhone sales and increased competition
2. Berkshire's substantial reduction in Apple holdings
3. The possibility of further trimming by Berkshire
4. Overall market and economic uncertainties

Given that the onions for appl options will be down after earnings, this would be an excellent time to short appl. This is not financial advice.

>**It is being widely reported that Berkshire's operating earnings declined 6.2% in the quarter. No. The reported figures include unrealized currency losses in 2024 and gains in 2023 on BRK's debt denominated in foreign currencies, largely yen. Earnings really grew 8.5% in Q3 to $11.2 billion against $10.3 billion and were up 18.0% for the nine months to $33.0 billion from $28.0 billion. Just as short-term movements in equity prices can distort the reporting of operating profits, so to do currency swings on debt outstanding. Both should be excluded from an analysis of operating and economic profit.**

2024-12-19,Is scaled mirroring of Berkshire Hathaway investments a good strategy?,"I have devised a strategy to invest in the same assets as Berkshire Hathaway but scaled to fit my own economic capacity. The idea is to mirror their investment choices, buying into the same companies and assets that they do. This approach leverages the extensive research and expertise of Warren Buffett and his team, who have a proven track record of successful investments. By aligning my portfolio with theirs, I aim to benefit from their insights and decisions.

However, I recognize that simply copying their investments is not enough. To enhance this strategy, I plan to divest from these assets at the same time Berkshire Hathaway does. This means closely monitoring their quarterly filings and public announcements to stay informed about their buying and selling activities. By doing so, I hope to avoid potential downturns and capitalize on their timing.

There are several factors to consider with this approach. First, there is a lag between when Berkshire Hathaway makes a move and when it becomes public knowledge. This delay could impact the effectiveness of my strategy, as market conditions may change in the interim. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway's scale allows them to diversify across various sectors, which might be challenging for a smaller investor like myself.

Moreover, their reasons for divesting might be based on factors that do not apply to my situation, such as tax considerations or strategic shifts. Therefore, it is crucial to adapt their strategy to my own financial goals and risk tolerance. Conducting my own research and maintaining a diversified portfolio will be essential to mitigate risks.

In summary, while mirroring Berkshire Hathaway's investments can provide a solid framework, it is important to tailor the strategy to my unique circumstances and remain vigilant about market conditions and timing.",0,14

2025-01-10,Berkshire Hathaway owns Geico. Can this company be negatively affected by the ongoing California fires? ,"Question is straghtforward. The current fires in California have already caused roughly $55 B in damages. This sounds like a massive problem for home insurers, one of which is Geico. I want to estimate how much this can impact Berkshire Hathaway's earnings. Let's see if we can come up with a number. According to its latest 10-Q, in the first nine months of 2024, about 28% of Berkshire's revenue came from the insurance sector, and 11% if we consider just Geico (but how much is this homeowners' insurance, I don't know).

2025-02-13,Warren Buffett’s $325 Billion Question,"Warren Buffett currently holds a massive cash reserve, totaling around $325 billion, which represents approximately 30% of Berkshire Hathaway’s assets. But why?

Some believe he is anticipating a market crash, although historically, timming the market has never been his investment strategy. Others argue that the market is overvalued, but even in such conditions, experienced investors can still find good opportunities (Berkshire bought Apple in 2016, when everyone thought it was overvalued, and ended up giving extraordinary returns).

In my opinion, Buffett may be preparing the company for a long-term strategic move: ensuring that Berkshire has enough capital to buy back its own shares after his passing.

It is well known that Warren Buffett does not believe in the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). He and other *value investing* advocates have demonstrated in practice that markets can be irrational in the short term, creating opportunities for those who are patient and disciplined.

2025-02-18,Warren Buffett’s Berkshire buys more Occidental after 30% sell-off from record high,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway purchased more shares of Occidental Petroleum after the oil and gas producer tumbled more than 30% from its record high.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate scooped up 763,017 shares of the Houston-based energy company on Friday for $35.7 million, according to a regulatory filing. Berkshire is Occidental’s biggest investor, holding a 28.2% stake.

Shares of Occidental have fallen nearly 32% from an all-time high reached last April. The stock dropped more than 17% in 2024 as oil prices weakened.

  
In late December, Berkshire purchased 8.9 million Occidental shares during a broad market pullback. Occidental remains Berkshire’s sixth-largest equity holding.

Buffett has made clear he won’t take full control of the oil company, founded by legendary oilman Armand Hammer. There had been speculation of a takeover after Berkshire received regulatory approval to buy as much as a 50% stake.

**What companies will do well for ever?**

The world 30 years ago was quite different from today, and change is probably just speeding up. Lets also add that you cant two very very similar companies, like Cola and Pepsi; or multiple railroads.

My picks:

1. **Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/B):** Diversified beast: Railroads (BNSF), Utilities, manufacturing, plus blue-chip holdings like Coca-Cola and Amex. They also have the fattest pocketbook in the world and can enter what business they damn please---for example like they did with apple a few years ago. Built to endure.
2. **Amazon (AMZN):** Unrivalled logistics and cloud infrastructure (AWS) create a nearly insurmountable moat; their scale and efficiency in delivering both physical goods and digital services are unmatched. They are sort of the digital backbone of America, for both retail and essential cloud infrastructure. Competitors can't replicate this position overnight, if ever. It's funny though, 30 years ago Amazon was something like 200 days old.
3. Struggling with this one. Torn between:
   * **Waste Management (WM):** Garbage will always be a problem.
   * **The New York Times (NYT):** This newspaper probably never goes away.
   * **Madison Square Garden Entertainment (MSGE) (Knicks+Rangers):** I think sports are for ever, and i think NYC is for ever; Knicks and Rangers are great brands with deep history.
   * **Universal Music Group (UMG):** Music is for ever, and these guys are in a very good position with their music rights.
   * **JPMorgan Chase (JPM):** Banking giant. Financial system backbone, hard to see it go away. The largest banks have changed over time though. There are temptations to be stupid in banking and that can have big consequences. Citi used to be king; Lehman actually went bust. Still i think JPM is for ever.
   * **Moody's (MCO):** Ratings agencies = near-monopoly in a for ever necessary service. Hard to see this change imo.

i think my third pick might actually be **MSGE**...

2025-02-24,Berkshire Hathaway deep dive and intrinsic value estimate by Chris Bloomstran of Semper Augustus,"Chris Bloomstran is considered an expert on Berkshire Hathaway. He runs a fund called Semper Augustus and every year, he writes a massive 100+ page letter to his fundholders and the public. In it, there is a large section where he does an annual deep dive into Berkshire and gives an estimate on the intrinsic value of the company. You won't find a more comprehensive Berkshire analysis that is up to date anywhere. It starts on page 97 and goes to page 163 and is a bit of a slog, but if you have never read one of his letters, it is worth a read. This letter was released Friday night, so he did not have access to the annual report. Bloomstran tends to give a high valuation compared to other analysis to Berkshire, so take that how you see fit.

2025-02-24,"Warren Buffett sounds warning to Washington as Berkshire reports record profit, cash","https://www.reuters.com/business/warren-buffett-says-us-should-spend-wisely-plans-increase-investment-japan-2025-02-22/?utm_source=reddit.com

NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the ""short straws in life.""

Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.

The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.

He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly shown his ability"" to deploy capital.

""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.

Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.

Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.

Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.

Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.

""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.

'FISCAL FOLLY'

This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.

""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.

Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.

He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by ""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.

He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""

Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on people's ability to participate.

That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.

""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.
""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,"" he added.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.

Other stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.

Berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.
The company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.

Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.

""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.

Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.

Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""

The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.
In discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.

""We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,"" he said. ""In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.""

2025-02-25,Berkshire Hathaway deep dive and intrinsic value estimate by Chris Bloomstran of Semper Augustus,"Chris Bloomstran is considered an expert on Berkshire Hathaway. He runs a fund called Semper Augustus and every year, he writes a massive 100+ page letter to his fundholders and the public. In it, there is a large section where he does an annual deep dive into Berkshire and gives an estimate on the intrinsic value of the company. You won't find a more comprehensive Berkshire analysis that is up to date anywhere. It starts on page 97 and goes to page 163 and is a bit of a slog, but if you have never read one of his letters, it is worth a read. This letter was released Friday night, so he did not have access to the annual report. Bloomstran tends to give a high valuation compared to other analysis to Berkshire, so take that how you see fit.

2025-02-26,DD: ET (Energy Transfer - midstream) LEAP opportunities,"This post is calling out some primo LEAP opportunities for the midstream stock ET.  

I’m loaded with Jan 2026 Calls for the strike price of $22 and $25. This post is a play on the bullish case for domestic US energy/oil.

**Highlights for why you might be interested:**

* Recent agreement reached with a tech company I’ve never heard of: [CloudBurst Data Centers on Feb 10th](https://ir.energytransfer.com/news-releases/news-release-details/energy-transfer-and-cloudburst-sign-agreement-natural-gas-supply). This is the first publicly made agreement and a significant precedent for partnerships in midstream at this scale. ET supposedly [“has requests from more than 70 prospective data centers in 12 states.""](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/19/energy-transfer-looks-to-turbocharge-growth-spendi/)  Everyone knows nuclear companies are eventually going to be the standard, but that’s only if the industry can get there in 5+ years. When the OKLO and friends bubble pops, Tech companies will need to be realistic about how to get their energy and pivot to domestic energy sourcing: enter ET  
* Biden banned [new off-shore drilling in the US just before leaving office](https://news.mongabay.com/short-article/president-biden-bans-offshore-oil-and-gas-drilling-for-many-u-s-waters). Why do you think Trump is calling the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America? It’s so that we can be confident drilling in our own backyard again. If this executive order is revered, midstream is positioned to capitalize on any increase of drilling.  
* ET is putting [$5 billion into growth over 2025, up $3 billion from 2024](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/energy-transfer-earnings-growth-2024-sets-up-an-impressive-outlook-2025-27). More growth === more fees === more profit for investors. As well, In their recent Q$ earnings, [ET saw it’s EBITDA grow 8%](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/19/energy-transfer-looks-to-turbocharge-growth-spendi/), and forecast a continued increase for the 2025 fiscal year. This is important since EBITDA is the main metric that midstream companies use to grow.  
* ET currently trades at an enterprise value (EV)-to-EBITDA multiple of about 8.5 times the high end of its 2025 guidance. While its valuation has risen, it's still significantly where it traded before the pandemic.    
* ET [*increased* dividends on their Q4 earnings for fy '24](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/ET/energy-transfer-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-results-and-announces-gh1vgkt2s9sc.html). Take this as you will for confidence on outlook for fy 2025. 
* [Energy demand for AI is still growing in 2025](https://x.com/davidsacks/status/1893341994098860330?s=46), not decreasing. Despite the recent volatility in the AI space, demand for energy/LNG/oil sourced domestically is continuing to rise. 
* Warren Buffet [continues to increase his position in OXY](https://www.investopedia.com/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-grows-stake-in-occidental-petroleum-11678787#:~:text=Warren%20Buffett's%20Berkshire%20Hathaway%20purchased,ownership%20stake%20in%20the%20company.). OXY, while not ET, offers exposure to upstream/midstream/downstream oil. 

Risk/Callouts:  

ET is transparent that is expects a lot of [its growth services to go into service by 2026](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/19/energy-transfer-looks-to-turbocharge-growth-spendi). Depending on the patience as an investor with other opportunities in the market, you might not be rushing to get Call options/positions on this stock. That’s why we’re getting LEAPS for when (not if) future catalysts and growth start getting priced in.

2025-02-26,"Warren Buffett sounds warning to Washington as Berkshire reports record profit, cash","https://www.reuters.com/business/warren-buffett-says-us-should-spend-wisely-plans-increase-investment-japan-2025-02-22/?utm_source=reddit.com

NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the ""short straws in life.""

Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.

The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.

He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly shown his ability"" to deploy capital.

""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.

Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.

Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.

Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.

Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.

""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.

'FISCAL FOLLY'

This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.

""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.

Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.

He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by ""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.

He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""

Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on people's ability to participate.

That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.

""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.
""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,"" he added.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.

Other stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.

Berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.
The company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.

Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.

""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.

Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.

Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""

The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.
In discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.

""We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,"" he said. ""In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.""

SPY... which is influenced by high-growth tech stocks, Berkshire benefits from its diversified, value-oriented portfolio, including strong holdings in energy, insurance, and industrials—sectors that thrive amid rising interest rates and economic resilience. Buffett’s disciplined capital allocation, good cash reserves, and defensive positioning provide stability during market volatility, making BRK.B in my opinion a superior long-term play in an uncertain macroeconomic landscape.

2025-03-21,Critique my portfolios - will I be ok?,"Hi everyone, I didn’t take retirement seriously but life has changed my perspective on a lot of things recently. I’m looking for some advice/ opinions, much appreciated in advance!

Years until full retirement: 37
I’ve started to contribute ~$250 a month into IRA and 6% of salary (~75k) with match into 401k. 401k has about 17k. So as of now Im putting in about 1k/month with the match and In not sure it’s enough.

My questions are: 

1) In roughly 37 years and a conservative outlook, will I be able to live comfortably? I know there are a bunch of factors like location, future inflation, etc but just curious. Thinking of withdrawing 60-70k a year. Honestly I’m not even factoring SSI because I doubt it’ll be a thing by then. 

2) Are these portfolios good for now? I know theres some overlap in the Roth,  especially Apple but thats a personal preference.

401k: 
Guaranteed Interest Fund – 5%
 • Dodge & Cox Income I – 5%
 • MFS Value R6 – 10%
 • Vanguard 500 Index Admiral (VOO equivalent) – 30%
 • JPMorgan Large Cap Growth R6 – 10%

 • JPMorgan Mid Cap Growth R5 – 5%
 • Vanguard Small Cap Index Admiral – 10%
 • MFS International Diversification R6 – 5%
 • Vanguard Total International Stock Index Admiral (VXUS equivalent) – 10%

ROTH: VOO (S&P 500) – 20%
 • SCHG (Growth ETF) – 10%

2025-03-23,"Rate My Finances (18y/o, ~$5,000 Net Worth, Going to College This Fall)","I currently have 90% of my money in a Roth IRA split between Vanguard and Interactive Brokerages. I use Vanguard for set it and forget it index funds and IBRK for slightly more active trading - nothing too risky - no options tradings, no day trading, all long positions on individual stocks. I occasionally use indicators like RSI and MACD to time my investments into stocks that I was already planning to buy. 

My current portfolio looks like this: 40% VTI (Total U.S. Stock Market), 30% VEA (International Developed Market), 10% VWO (International Emerging Market), 10% BRK.B (Berkshire Hathaway), 10% Mixed Bag of Individual Stocks. 

I thought about making it simpler by just doing VTI and VEA. As I near retirement age I plan to gradually increase my bond allocation but right now having any bonds at all seems detrimental. If I had a higher  risk appetite and a more positive outlook on the big tech stocks right now, I might replace VTI for VOO as it has better historical performance (not an indicator of future gains, blah blah...) but I really am concerned by how concentrated the S&P 500 is.

p.s. there's nothing special about Vanguard ETFs. I just find that they typically have competitive expense ratios and like the idea of having all/most of my index funds from one brokerage. I think Fidelity and Schwab are great options too. I've also heard good things about M1 Finance but they seem a little experimental so I just stick with Vanguard and IBKR. 

Here are some of the stocks in the mixed bag, 10% allocation, traded on IBKR: TRI, SSP, SCHL, CHGG, LMND, TQQQ, UTHR, WAB, PGR, JPM.

I have a credit score of 799 and have never missed a payment (thanks Mom for letting me be an authorized user on your credit card). Three cards make up that score (Chase Freedom Flex, Some Random Discover Card and a STEP Card). I have considered looking into a money market account at Chase so that my savings/emergency fund can earn a little more but don't fully understand it enough atm to pull the trigger. 

I have been super fortunate to have been supported financially by my parents. Up until this point I have had decent transportation to and from school/work, plenty of food on the table, quality electronics and resources for studying, gaming and programming (not to mention clothes and a roof over my head). Most of the money I have now came from working at a local credit union over the summer and fall of last year along with saving all the money I got from things like Christmas and Birthday. I also worked for my Dad every once in a while as a kid and he would sometimes pay me depending on the work (bringing him tools for his construction/repair/contracting/renewable energy business). My largest asset is the Macbook I'm typing this on (I'm a reluctant mac user :p). Neither of my parents are fabulously wealthy and they don't plan to contribute anything to my college education (I'm hoping I might be able to live at home during some transition periods so I don't have to drain my savings on a rent deposit when I haven't figured out my employment situation or things like that). Oh, and also I have  no debt (woop woop!).

On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate my finances? How fortunate is the situation I am in in terms of privilege and do you have any advice for how to contextualize all of the privilege I have been given. There is certainly some bad shit that I have intentionally left out of here but I am curious from a purely financial standpoint where I stand in terms of what percentile of people have it as good as I do at 18 and what part of that is due to making informed decisions or being given parental support. 

Are there any problems with the individual stocks that I chose or should I have a more concrete/outlined strategy in that section - perhaps swapping out larger companies like JPM, for more small cap stocks to even out the large caps that tend to be in low-expense ratio ETFs like VTI? How redundant is having 10% BRK.B and can that be justified? Does TQQQ have any utility? Feel free to answer all or none of these questions. ",0,12

# Key Takeaways

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

2025-05-02,This Saturday might actually give investors a 💡when Buffet tells everyone that they SOLD MORE.,"Speculation is… 

Berkshire Hathaway may continue to reduce its stock positions at the upcoming shareholder meeting on May 3, 2025.

1. Significant Stock Sales: In 2024, Berkshire sold approximately $133.2 billion in stocks, including reductions in major holdings like Apple, Bank of America, and Citigroup. 

2. Record Cash Reserves: Berkshire's cash reserves have surpassed $300 billion, indicating a cautious approach to new investments amid market uncertainties. 

3. Defensive Strategy Amid Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Persistent inflation risks, uncertainty around interest rate policy, trade wars, and geopolitical instability have led Berkshire to adopt a more defensive posture.

Given these factors, it's plausible that Berkshire Hathaway will continue to pare down its stock positions, especially in overvalued sectors. The company's substantial cash holdings position it well to capitalize on future market opportunities.

And then 💥. Realization to the market and might actually show how bad this economy has gotten.

2025-05-04,WSJ: Why There Will Never Be Another Warren Buffett,"A great article by Jason Zweig on Warren Buffett after his announcement that he will retire at year-end.

https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/why-there-will-never-be-another-warren-buffett-2b5fa268

Excerpt:

There’s only one Warren Buffett, and there will never be another.

On May 3, Buffett announced that he will step down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate he has built into one of the most successful investments in history. There are three reasons why he has no equal and never will: the person, the period and the package.

Let’s start with the person. Buffett is not only brilliant, but he has also spent nearly his entire long lifetime obsessed with the stock market. Especially in his early years as an investor, his unparalleled success depended on an unbearable sacrifice: forgoing a normal social and family life. 

Ever since 1942, when he bought his first stock at age 11, he has devoured information about companies, reading corporate reports the way most people listen to music. 

As a young investment manager, Buffett would wander through his house with his nose in a corporate annual report, practically bumping into the furniture, oblivious to the comings and goings of family and friends. While his kids played at an amusement park, he would sit on a bench and read financial statements. Buffett was there physically, but mentally and emotionally he was off in a world of his own, fixated on tax-loss carryforwards and amortization schedules.

Imagine being that obsessed. Imagine enjoying it.

Now imagine enjoying it almost every waking moment ever since Harry Truman was in the White House. That’s how unusual Buffett is.

Expertise is rooted in pattern recognition, and Buffett has seen every conceivable pattern. Given what I know about his work habits, I estimate—conservatively, I believe—that Buffett has read more than 100,000 financial statements in his more-than-seven-decade career. 

Finally, Buffett placed his investments in a package like none other.

Berkshire Hathaway operates as a publicly traded holding company, a receptacle for whatever he has thought worth owning: other publicly traded stocks, Treasury bonds, private companies. At one point it was even one of the world’s largest holders of silver; now it holds more than $330 billion in cash. 

Berkshire isn’t a hedge fund, mutual fund, exchange-traded fund or any other conventional investment vehicle.

By design, it charges no management fees that would subtract from its returns and no performance-incentive fees that would encourage excessive risk-taking in pursuit of a big payday.

Most investment funds operate under a curse that economists call “procyclicality.” After a fund racks up a streak of good returns, investors throw money at the fund, forcing its managers to put the new cash to work in a market that is likely becoming overpriced. That hinders future performance.

Then, when returns falter in a falling market, investors yank their money out, forcing the fund managers to sell just as bargains are becoming abundant. The fund’s own investors make its performance worse, intensifying the market’s ups and downs.

Berkshire’s only cash flows, however, are internal. Money comes in from (or goes out to) the assets it owns. Cash can’t come pouring in from new investors, or get yanked out by fleeing investors, at the worst possible times—because you can invest in Berkshire only by buying shares from someone else in the secondary market.

This package has given Buffett a structural advantage that has enabled him to pursue opportunities wherever and whenever he has perceived them. That’s a luxury almost no other professional investor has—or even wants.

So long as most fund managers can earn a lavish living for underperforming the market, the real risk for them will be trying anything different. Pigs will sprout feathers before anybody has the daring to try truly emulating Warren Buffett.",389,99
2025-05-04,Warren Buffet: Trade Should not be a weapon,"Trump are you listening?

Berkshire Hathaway Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett addressed US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies at the company’s annual meeting in Omaha, saying trade “should not be a weapon.” 

“You can make some very good arguments for the fact that balanced trade is good for the world,” Buffett said in response to a question about trade barriers. “There is no question that trade can be an act of war.”

He added that the US “should be looking to trade with the rest of the world.”

Even though the market has corrected and is recovering, Buffett has yet to make any major purchases.

Everyone likes to see Warren Buffett's massive cash pile as a sign that the market is about to turn, but the reality is that the majority of his portfolio (70%) is still in stocks. Cash only accounts for 30%, and this is simply part of Berkshire Hathaway's investment style, which has been keeping cash on hand for years to be flexible in any situation.",335,100

Buffett’s statement that he has no intention of selling a single share and plans to give it all away gradually reinforces his commitment to philanthropy and long-term alignment with Berkshire shareholders. This echoes his previous plans to donate the vast majority of his wealth, primarily through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other foundations tied to his family.

While Buffett is 94 and Abel was designated as CEO successor in 2021, it nonetheless came as surprise to the thousands of admiring shareholders gathered for this year’s annual meeting to once again hear the investing legend opine on the future of the company.

> “Tomorrow, we’re having a board meeting of Berkshire, and we have 11 directors. Two of the directors, who are my children, Howie and Susie, know of what I’m going to talk about there. The rest of them, this will come as news to, but I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,” said Buffett, in the final few minutes of the meeting.

> Buffett, who took over as CEO of the former textiles company in 1965, said he will still ‘hang around’ to help, but the final word on company operations and capital deployment would be with Abel, 62, currently the vice chairman of non-insurance operations for Berkshire. “I could be helpful, I believe, in that in certain respects, if we ran into periods of great opportunity or anything,” he added. Buffett, who owns more than $160 billion in Berkshire as its largest sharholder, said he wouldn’t sell a single share of the stock after he transitions to this new phase.",435,45

2025-05-05,Berkshire Hathaway shares fall after shocking Buffett exit and an earnings decline,"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/05/berkshire-hathaway-shares-dip-nearly-3percent-after-shocking-buffett-exit-and-an-earnings-decline.html

> Berkshire Hathaway shares are under pressure Monday as investors process Warren Buffett’s surprise announcement to step down and envision a new path for the conglomerate after his legendary 60-year run. Buffett, 94, picked the very last moment at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, to tell his loyal shareholders that it’s time for Greg Abel, vice chairman of non-insurance operations, to replace him as CEO. The board voted unanimously on Sunday to make Abel president and CEO on Jan. 1, 2026, and for Buffett to remain as chairman.

> “Shareholders should welcome this transparent transition, but also have confidence that Warren isn’t going anywhere,” said Macrae Sykes, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds and a Berkshire shareholder. “Retaining the position of Chairman means he can continue to mentor Greg and the Berkshire leaders, while also providing additional intellectual capacity when the inevitable time for more major capital allocation occurs.”

> It marks an end of an epic era for Berkshire, which was a failing New England textile mill six decades ago when Buffett used an investment partnership he ran to take control. Berkshire has grown into a one-of-a-kind juggernaut worth nearly $1.2 trillion with businesses encompassing insurance, railroad, retail, manufacturing and energy. Buffett is handing over his reins on a particularly high note as Berkshire shares just reached a new peak Friday. “Buffett leaves a company that is less reliant on his investing capabilities, with an array of leading businesses with strong cash flows,” Brian Meredith, UBS’ Berkshire analyst, said in a note. “Operationally, we expect little change at BRK and the culture/strategy to remain unchanged under Abel.”",868,142

2025-05-05,Berkshire Hathaway‘s Future,"I think most people in this sub are aware that Buffett has stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Personally, I’ve never invested in Berkshire—mostly because I never really took the time to look at their financials or charts.

But today I had a quick look, and I was honestly impressed by how well the company has performed over the years.

Now that there’s been a major leadership change, I’m curious: what do you think the future holds for Berkshire?

Are there any shareholders here?",51,72
2025-05-06,$35K Profit Shorting Berkshire Hathaway,"I opened a $53K position on June 475 $BRK.B puts last week.  After the company reported its worst earnings in 5 years and the “Oracle of Omaha” announced his retirement, I predicted that the stock would drop 5% today and wanted to gauge WallStreetBets sentiment to see if I was right:  

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/Rqaw5VCvT4

Sure enough, many of the responses basically amounted to saying I was an idiot and that the stock wouldn’t be down on Monday because Buffett leaving was “priced in”.

Well, $BRK.B closed down 5.12% today.  I sold 41 contracts (out of 131) of the June 475 puts and then bought the dip on the June 485 puts.  I think the stock grinds lower in the coming 1-2 months.

2025-05-10,Warren Buffett and the Berkshire Hathaway Paradox - The Intellectual Investor,"I am back from what has become over the past two decades an annual pilgrimage to Omaha. 

What’s fascinating about this trip is that it has everything and nothing to do with Warren Buffett. The main event that draws everyone to Omaha – the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) annual meeting – is actually the least important part. I could have watched the shareholder meeting livestreamed on YouTube from the comfort of my living room couch.

The emergence of the Berkshire phenomenon reminds me of China’s manufacturing evolution. China initially attracted capital because of its cheap labor. But over time, China took this capital and plowed it into infrastructure. Factories were built next to each other, each specializing in certain areas. A specialized ecosystem emerged. 

Today, Chinese labor is no longer cheap. It’s been replaced by automation, and now China is a powerhouse for manufacturing anything and everything.

The transformation that the BRK weekend has undergone followed a similar progression. Initially, the only way to absorb Buffett and Munger’s wisdom was to come to Omaha, as the event was not streamed. But then something interesting happened. The BRK weekend attracted people who shared the same value system, and friendships were formed. A variety of smaller events began to be scheduled throughout the same weekend across Omaha, and an equally specialized ecosystem emerged.

The shareholder meeting began to be streamed about ten years ago, but that has had no impact on attendance. This is one reason why I think Buffett is at peace with the idea of no longer presiding at the meeting – people will still come to Omaha the weekend before Mother’s Day.

The BRK weekend now features dozens of excellent events. 

I spoke at several, including an investing panel at Creighton University, alongside the wonderful Bob Robotti, a die-hard value investor who runs Robotti & Co. I’ve known Bob for years – at 72, he exhibits the same enthusiasm for stocks as someone decades younger – and this panel was an excellent example of what the BRK Omaha ecosystem has produced.

Bob and I have very different approaches to value investing. He loves cyclical businesses, while I generally shun them. Bob mentioned that he’d buy a very cheap business run by a mediocre manager, while I would not touch it with a ten-foot pole. 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with either approach; indeed, there is an important lesson in it. Your investment philosophy and process have to fit your personality and your EQ. In my case, I get nervous (and thus irrational) when I own companies run by imbeciles who don’t have either skin or soul in the game. But the great thing about the BRK weekend is that I learn from Bob every time I spend time with him. He’s a thoughtful and genuinely kind human being. 

From the outside, the BRK weekend may seem like a place where people simply want to learn how to get and stay rich. But this gathering transcends value investing and capitalism and genuinely celebrates human values. People (like me) bring their kids to this event. And just like at the main event, at the Q&A breakfast I hosted for my readers, many questions centered on life rather than investing.

My first Omaha reader meetup fit around a small restaurant table. This year, to my surprise, 450 people packed into a venue with standing-room only. I answered questions on every imaginable topic for just over two hours, and by the end I was exhausted. 

This gave me even greater admiration for Buffett, who is four decades my senior, yet still fielded questions for four solid hours. I was delighted to hear Warren give a similar answer to one I had given the day before when asked what advice he’d give to graduating students: 

“Don’t worry too much about starting salaries and be very careful who you work for because you will take on the habits of the people around you.” 

(Incidentally, we are going to host our next Q&A Breakfast on May 1, 2026. You can sign up for it [**here**](https://investor.fm/lets-get-together-in-omaha/). It’s free, but I suggest you sign up early, as it fills up fast.)

I also participated (as I have for over a decade) in an investing panel at YPO (Young President Organization) in the beautiful Holland Performance Art Center with Tom Gaynor, CEO of Markel (often described as a baby Berkshire Hathaway) and Lawrence Cunningham. Lawrence authored perhaps the most important book about Buffett, *The Essays of Warren Buffett,* masterfully editing Warren’s annual letters into a cohesive volume. This year’s panel was one of those occasions where I found myself listening intently to my fellow panelists instead of speaking more.

Lawrence has met Greg Abel – Buffett’s designated successor – and feels optimistic about him. He’s probably right – this was one of Buffett’s most crucial decisions, which he did not make lightly. Yet I can’t imagine sitting for four hours listening to Greg Abel. I am sure he is a brilliant CEO, but he’s neither Buffett nor Munger – few individuals possess so much worldly wisdom and communicate it with such clarity and humor.

This brings me to the point of this note: the dramatic (yet not unexpected) announcement that Buffett is stepping down as CEO of BRK at the end of the year.

Before I comment on this, let me tell you a story. Imagine you have been watching a soap opera for 17 years. You arrive dutifully every year to watch every episode in person. And then you miss the last five minutes of the explosive finale before it goes off the air. This is what happened to me when Buffett announced his retirement as CEO.

A few minutes before noon, while Buffett was answering a question I’d heard before and appeared to be winding down, I suggested we slip out early for lunch to avoid the crowds. When we came back, I discovered that the meeting had gone on until 1 pm, and just before it ended, Buffett announced that he would step down at the end of the year. Seventeen years of watching Warren speak and I missed the most dramatic moment of all, followed by a five-minute standing ovation.

I think Buffett has engineered his exit brilliantly. He will still remain chairman, and even before the announcement he was not managing BRK’s day-to-day operations. As a collection of hundreds of companies that often have absolutely nothing in common with each other, BRK is already highly decentralized. Buffett’s main contribution has been capital allocation.

Giving up the CEO title while he’s still alive means Buffett has brought in his replacement in an orderly way and created a smooth transition. But I have a feeling that on January 1, 2026, when Greg Abel officially becomes CEO, nothing will really change, and Warren will continue doing what he’s been doing for as long as he can. If Buffett is able – he’ll be 95 – he’ll still drive to the office and stop by McDonald’s for a breakfast sandwich (there’s a lot of wisdom in finding pleasure in little things). His son Howard Buffett will become chairman after Warren, with his only job being to preserve the culture.

I’ve been asked what I think of BRK stock. We bought the stock during the pandemic. It has done better than I expected, in part because of the strong performance of Apple, which was BRK’s largest holding. But BRK today is an unexciting investment at its current price. In all honesty, it is a conglomerate with some good and some merely okay businesses.

As a consumer, I get a (small) glimpse into how BRK businesses are being run by visiting Dairy Queen. BRK owns DQ, and I love their soft-serve ice cream (though I only eat it when I travel). My favorite part of research!

DQ has (or maybe had) a strong brand and operates on a capital-light model as a franchisor. But most stores I have visited looked like they have been neglected and need fresh paint. To be sure, I understand the limitations of this “analysis,” and DQ overall amounts to a rounding error on BRK’s financials. But little things often reveal much about big things.

BRK’s big businesses, from what I can glean through their financials, are not particularly well managed – GEICO and BNSF (railroad) have definitely been undermanaged lately. BNSF is not nearly as efficient as its competitors that embraced precision railroading, and until recently GEICO was losing market share to Progressive. 

BRK’s reinsurance business, a significant source of BRK’s profitability, is run by the extraordinary Ajit Jain. Ajit is in his 70s and unfortunately it seems he is not in great health. Is his replacement going to shoot the lights out, like he did? We don’t know. But Ajit is probably more important to BRK today than Buffett.

BRK is not going to melt into oblivion after Buffett is gone, but its best days are behind it. As Buffett has acknowledged, just its size alone makes it very difficult for BRK to grow. Truth be told, even if Buffett were thirty years younger and continued to run BRK, I am not sure the results would be much different than what I think the future holds with Abel at the helm. 

Buffett and Charlie Munger had a tremendous impact on me as an investor and human being. I am incredibly thankful to both. 

I hope Warren is there next year, but, in either case, I will be. As value investors say, “next year in Omaha”.

I live outside the U.S., and I’m just a regular person trying to build something for my family. I believe in long-term investing and holding through the ups and downs, but what happens if World War 3 really breaks out?

Will the U.S. market totally crash? Will the dollar still hold value?
Will ETF providers like Vanguard or BlackRock even function in a global crisis?
Will the markets freeze or be closed like during a big war?

I know the usual advice is ""stay the course,"" but if bombs start flying and the internet is down… staying the course might mean watching everything go to zero.

Just wondering what others think. I’m not trying to panic, just trying to understand what the real risks are.

Has anyone studied how stock markets performed during WW1 or WW2?

Is there anything long-term investors can do now, just in case?

Appreciate any insights.",0,126

2025-06-09,What would you pay for Berkshire Hathaway? Here’s how I think about it.,"Someone asked me recently, *“What would you pay for Berkshire Hathaway?”* Thought I’d open it up here because I think it’s a pretty relevant question right now.

Berkshire’s not a typical company. It’s part operating business, part investment portfolio. You’re getting businesses like Geico and BNSF, but also huge public holdings in Apple, Coca-Cola, AmEx, and more. Plus a massive cash position, well over $100 billion.

So how do you value that?

First, I look at **book value**. Historically, Berkshire trades around 1.3 to 1.5 times book. But with interest rates rising and market multiples normalizing, that should compress.

Warren Buffett himself has said he would buy back shares at **1.2 times book value or below** if he believes the stock is trading below intrinsic value. That is a pretty strong signal, and it gives us a decent benchmark.

Second, I look at **earnings power**. Between its operating businesses and its investment portfolio, Berkshire is still a cash machine. But it is no longer a 20 percent compounding machine like it was in its early days. The law of large numbers applies here.

If I had to name a number today, I would start getting interested around that 1.2x book value range. Maybe lower depending on how the macro looks. Anything much higher and I do not see the margin of safety.

Would love to hear how others are approaching Berkshire. Are you a buyer here, or are you waiting for a pullback? How do you factor in the Apple position or Buffett’s eventual departure?",0,38

2025-06-14,Is investing only in Bitcoin and Berkshire Hathaway crazy?,"I'm no financial expert. That's why I'm asking for your input.

I've been taking the pulse of the market over the last few months. Things are pointing towards a recession and/or an inflation spiral.

I don't want to time the dip, so I have concluded that DCA into Berkshire Hathaway might be a logical decision, especially since I believe in value investing and they have a cash pile for when things will crash again or more.

Also, I'm thinking about allocating a fairly big portion of my portfolio to Bitcoin. The way institutions are adopting it indicates that it might be less crazy to do so compared to a few years ago. It would be a hedge against inflation.

I have mixed feelings about these moves, since they're not traditional financial moves. Usually, I should spread it out in S&P 500, money market, bonds, some stocks, Gold, Silver, etc.

But my gut instinct tells me to go half half on the two assets I mentioned. I intend to hold them for at least 15 years.

What do you guys think? Is it utterly irrational or does it make sense?",0,110

2025-07-09,Planning a long-term investment company inspired by Berkshire Hathaway. Curious what others think about the idea.,"Back in 2010, a few friends and I started investing together. Just our own money, a shared spreadsheet, and lots of late-night calls about what to buy and why. Over time, more people joined, and somehow this little group turned into a real shareholder company.

We’ve averaged around 32% per year. It’s been a mix of long-term plays, patience, and probably some luck.

Now we’re thinking bigger. We want to expand across the EU and set up a European Shareholder Company (SE). Not a public company, but something more open and structured than what we have now.

We’re skipping full regulation (too expensive for our size) but will provide annual audits through a law firm. We’re also fully transparent. Every shareholder gets access to the accounts to see how things are going.

Legally, we can have up to 150 new investors per country per year without needing a license, which gives us room to grow.

We’re planning to base the company in Estonia, mostly for the 0% tax on reinvested profits.

2025-07-16,"Berkshire Hathaway down almost 14% in 3 months, and it's a Bargain at these prices!","With markets getting more and more irrational by the day over the course of the last few months, Berkshire has become more and more rational by the day.

Berkshire is sitting on 161USD pr share in cash, ready to take advantage of the irrationality of the markets that will inevitably unfold to rationality sooner or later, and its selling at 12x multiple, generating 80B of profits pr year, and and near 11% return on every dollar they put to use! I have said it before, and i will say it again. When Berkshire goes on sale, you better start buying, and it is on sale right now.

I do not think people really understand how great the core business of Berkshire is. The ownership of BNSF and Geico are so unique, and outright monopolies, and people price it as if its a dying business.

I think people really ought to reevaluate their portfolios, and study Berkshire at these prices. It is a great bargain with lots of downside protection!",1003,289
2025-07-17,To those concerned/panicking about Berkshire Hathaway's recent slump.,"Hi all.

In light of the recent price depreciation of Berkshire Hathaway shares, I see many investors and/or subredditors voicing their concerns particularly around the so-called “Buffett premium” and the company’s future leadership under Greg Abel. I’d like to share a perspective grounded in both Berkshire’s long-standing principles and the realities of its current positioning.

Greg Abel is not a newcomer to Berkshire Hathaway. He’s been a core part of its leadership for decades, having overseen large-scale capital allocation decisions, especially within Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger didn’t just casually endorse him; they handpicked him as Buffett’s successor, explicitly citing his competence, integrity, and capital allocation acumen. If we trust their decades-long emphasis on management quality as one of the most important facets of every Berkshire investment, *we should equally trust their decision when it comes to their own company*.

Buffett and Munger have long said that you want to build a company so durable that even an idiot could run it. While Abel is no idiot, Berkshire has been constructed with immense resilience + Buffett has obviously been making the moves to ensure Berkshire's longevity. The recent buildup of cash (now over $300 billion) isn’t just “dry powder” for Abel to deploy; it’s also a deliberate buffer - a safeguard. It ensures the company can withstand managerial missteps or macroeconomic shocks long after Buffett has stepped away.

As for the sell-off, it’s not solely due to the fading of Buffett’s shadow. There’s also broader negative sentiment around the Property and Casualty insurance sector. For instance, a major bank recently downgraded Progressive; Geico’s top competitor - only for Progressive to report stellar earnings today. This disconnect between perception and performance suggests the market is painting the entire insurance sector with too broad a brush.

Ironically, this fear creates an opportunity. According to Berkshire’s latest annual report, the company’s non-insurance businesses generated slightly higher operating profits than the insurance segment. That means the market’s bearishness on insurance is dragging down the valuation of high-quality, wholly owned subsidiaries, like BNSF, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and the manufacturing group, along with it. For long-term shareholders, this is not a reason to worry; it’s a reason to act.

Remember Buffett’s three most important words of investing - **margin of safety**. As a net buyer of Berkshire, you should be jumping for joy that the stock is currently on a sliding skid. It is now cheaper to purchase shares of a wonderful business that owns many, many fantastic subsidiaries. If you believe in the underlying fundamentals, the long-term opportunity has just become even more attractive.

And finally, if you are concerned with the every day price fluctuations of Berkshire Hathaway - unfortunately this is not the stock for you. Palantir might be a better place to deviate your eyes towards.",185,116

2025-07-31,Greg Abel and Berkshire Hathaway: The Quiet Power Behind the AI Race,"I’ve seen a lot of posts and chatter lately about the “Warren premium” fading and some doubt around Greg Abel. Just wanted to share a quick post in support. 

Edit: I used NotebookLM to get my thoughts and phrase it for simplicity


While the headlines are focused on the ""AI arms race"" between the US and China—a competition often framed in terms of who can develop the most advanced large language models, chips, and military applications—there's a crucial, often overlooked, dimension: the infrastructure that powers it all. And this is where Greg Abel and Berkshire Hathaway's strategy becomes so brilliantly relevant.


The ""Arms Race"" is really an ""Energy Race""
The development of AI isn't just about software; it's about hardware, and that hardware consumes immense amounts of power. Data centers, which are the backbone of all AI, are voracious energy consumers. The US government and tech giants alike are scrambling to build more data centers to cement American leadership in AI. This is where the core of Abel's expertise lies.
Greg Abel, as the long-time head of Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE), has spent his career managing and expanding one of the largest utility and energy infrastructure companies in North America. He understands the complex economics of power generation, transmission, and the intricate regulatory frameworks that govern it.
Berkshire's Role in National Security


The US's ability to ""win"" the AI race, both commercially and from a national security standpoint, is directly tied to its ability to provide cheap, reliable, and abundant energy. Without it, the most advanced AI models and defense systems can't function.
Under Abel's leadership, Berkshire Hathaway isn't trying to build the next ChatGPT or competing with NVIDIA. Instead, it's positioning itself as the indispensable foundation upon which the entire AI industry is built. By investing in and expanding its energy grid, BHE is enabling the very data centers that are critical to both tech companies and the government's AI initiatives. This is a far more stable, long-term, and strategically vital role than chasing the latest tech fad.


In a world where geopolitical power is increasingly measured by technological supremacy, Berkshire's strategic focus on energy infrastructure under Abel's guidance is not just a smart business decision—it's a critical component of American competitiveness. Buffett and Munger chose Abel not just for his business acumen, but because they saw that the future of power, and thus the future of technology and national security, would be in the hands of those who could literally keep the lights on.

2025-07-31,For those crying that Berkshire Hathaway doesn't invest in AI.,"I'll channel my inner Charlie Munger here: 

That is some astronomically *dumb* levels of first-order thinking.

What does AI require the most?

*Power.*

LLMs & cloud infrastructure is driving an insane demand for energy, particularly through hyperscale data centres. Specifically, AI workloads like GPT model training are significantly more power-intensive than traditional cloud tasks. 

Right now, the U.S is experiencing a surge in data centre construction; this mostly occurs in states with abundant and stable power grids - like Nevada, Iowa and most of the West.

Guess where Berkshire Hathaway Energy operates?

*All of the above.*

Berkshire Hathaway Energy's primary subsidiary (MidAmerican Energy) in Iowa is building Wind PRIME (a 2000+MW wind and solar project) - exactly the type of energy structure required to support AI data centre loads.

Not to mention NV Energy (another subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway) submitted filings in 2024 tied to Microsoft and Google data centre power requests exceeding 900MW. NV Energy serves power to Nevada (particularly the Reno area which is becoming a growing hub for AI and cloud infrastructure).

These are going to generate incredible cash flows & earnings over a long period of time.

When most of these speculative Redditors think of AI; their immediate thoughts are any company that produces chips or an LLM model.

What about the energy that's going to be needed to power all of this infrastructure? Or all the HVAC infrastructure that's going to be required to keep these data centres cool; specifically in Nevada where temperatures can be pretty darn hot. I own stock in a company called Comfort FIX Systems USA that provides cooling infrastructure to commercial buildings & data centres; the earnings have been incredible over the past couple of quarters.

So for those who are saying Berkshire is missing out on this 'AI Revolution' - think a bit deeper. There are going to be many beneficiaries from all this CapEx. In the 2024 10-K, the operating businesses marginally generated higher earnings than the insurance businesses. I think this gap will widen a lot more over time.

Oh, and by the way, guess who was the CEO of MidAmerican Energy / Berkshire Hathaway Energy for many many many years before being appointed to take over as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway next year?",264,47

2025-08-11,Buyback party everywhere… except BRK? Will they finally join in?,"So apparently 2025 is turning into a full-on **buyback festival**.

* YTD announced buybacks: **$983.6B** 🤯
* On track to break **$1.1T** for the year
* Tech & big banks leading the charge — Apple ($100B), Alphabet ($70B), JPM ($50B), BAC ($40B), Morgan Stanley ($20B)… you get the picture.

But here’s the thing:  
📉 **Berkshire Hathaway hasn’t bought back stock in 4 straight quarters**.  
Meanwhile, their cash pile is now sitting at **$344B** (yes, with a “B”).

Larry Fink even came out saying companies should balance buybacks with long-term investments — and we know Buffett’s been picky about when BRK repurchases.

So here’s my question:  
💭 With buybacks basically becoming a market-wide flex right now…

* Does anyone think BRK will finally step in this quarter?
* Or will Buffett just keep stacking cash until valuations drop?
* Is this just him waiting for a “fat pitch” like in 2020?

Personally, I’m torn — the market’s hyped on buybacks, and a BRK announcement could be a big catalyst… but Buffett’s track record says he won’t chase.

Curious to hear how you all are reading this. If the buyback wave keeps pushing the S&P, does BRK stay on the sidelines or join the party? 🥳🍿

2025-08-14,$UPS - back up the truck,"UPS DD: Why Papa Buffett’s About to Drop the Bombshell Buy Tomorrow – And Why You Should Load the Truck Before Amazon Tries to Steal Your Tendies! 
Listen up, I’ve got some solid DD on why the Oracle of Omaha, Warren “Infinite Money Glitch” Buffett, has been quietly stacking UPS shares like they’re discounted Cherry Coke at a Berkshire barbecue. 

Word on the street (and in those sneaky 13F filings) is that Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has been building a mystery position in a beaten-down industrial beast, and all signs point to United Parcel Service (UPS). Tomorrow, August 14th, when that Q2 13F drops after the bell, we’re gonna see the big reveal – and if it’s UPS, this bad boy’s gonna moon harder than Elon on a Twitter rant.

Let’s break down why he bought, why it’s bullish AF despite the recent dumpster fire chart, and why those “Amazon’s gonna crush ‘em” doomers can go short their own tendies. Let’s get those gains, fam!

Why Did Grandpa Buffett Buy UPS? ’Cause Value Plays Are His Love Language, not long walks on the beach. 
Buffett doesn’t chase hype like we chase YOLO options on earnings day. Nah, the man’s all about snagging moaty monsters at bargain-bin prices, and UPS is screaming “buy me, daddy!” right now. 

Back in Q1 2025, Berkshire’s 13F showed a sneaky $2 billion jump in the “Commercial, industrial and other” bucket – that’s code for “we’re hiding a gem from you copycat plebs.” 
Analysts are betting it’s UPS, a logistics juggernaut that’s down 30% YTD ‘cause Wall Street’s got the attention span of a goldfish on Adderall. But Buffett? He sees the moat wider than the Mississippi: proprietary networks, brown trucks everywhere, and relationships with every Fortune 500 that’s not named Bezos (more on that later).
UPS trades at a forward P/E of 13x – cheap compared to the S&P’s nosebleed 25x. Throw in a juicy 4.8% dividend yield, and you’ve got a cash cow that prints money while you sleep. Buffett’s been hoarding cash like a doomsday prepper ($277B in reserves last quarter! 3 ), and deploying it into stuff like this is how he turns recessions into retirement funds. Remember when he scooped Chubb in secret? Same playbook here – quiet buys to avoid the herd jacking up the price. UPS fits his vibe: predictable earnings from e-commerce boom, healthcare deliveries (vaccines and pills don’t ship themselves), and global expansion. It’s like BNSF Railway (which Berkshire owns) but for packages – infrastructure that lasts longer than your average 
marriage.

📈 Bullish AF Despite the Downtrend: This Ain’t a Dead Cat Bounce, It’s a Phoenix Rising!
Alright, bears, put down the put options and listen: UPS has been in a downtrend since ‘22 highs, tanking on labor strikes, soft volumes, and “recession fears” that never fully materialized. Chart looks like my portfolio after a bad theta gang week – straight down. But Buffett buys when blood’s in the streets, and here’s why this puppy’s poised to pump:
	•	E-Commerce Tailwinds, Baby! Online shopping ain’t slowing down; it’s exploding. UPS hauled 5.7B packages last year, and with inflation cooling, consumers are back to impulse-buying crap they don’t need. Guidance? 5-7% revenue growth and 10% EPS pop in ‘25. That’s tendie territory. 
	•	Efficiency Gains: Cutting Fat Like a Keto Bro Post-strike, UPS is slashing costs – $1B in savings from automation, EVs, and smarter routes. Margins expanding, free cash flow gushing ($10B+ expected). Buffett loves boring businesses that get better quietly, like a fine wine (or his Cherry Coke addiction).
	•	Diversification Game Strong: Not all eggs in Amazon’s basket. Healthcare logistics? Booming. International? Crushing it in Asia. And that dividend? Hiked 10 years straight – payout ratio under 60%, sustainable as hell.
Despite the dip, fundamentals scream undervalued: EV/EBITDA at 10x vs. historical 12x. 
Market’s pricing in doom, but Buffett’s betting on the rebound.
UPS might be down, but it’s not out – it’s just “parcel-ing” its energy for the upside surge!  

Amazon Won’t Kill UPS – It’ll Just Make It Stronger
Oh, the classic bear thesis: “Amazon’s building its own fleet, UPS is toast! Bezos gonna eat their lunch!” LMAO, sit down, Karen – let’s debunk this faster than a margin call.
	•	Amazon’s Still a Customer, Not a Killer: Yeah, Amazon cut UPS volume by 20% to build in-house, but UPS wants that. Low-margin Amazon hauls were dragging profits; now they’re focusing on high-margin SMBs and healthcare. Amazon’s only 13% of revenue – diversified AF. Plus, Amazon can’t replicate UPS’s global reach overnight; they’re partners, not mortal enemies.
	•	Moat Too Thicc for Bezos: UPS’s network? Unmatched – 220 countries, 500 planes, 120K vehicles. Amazon’s delivery game is US-heavy and loss-making. UPS profits while Amazon subsidizes Prime. Long-term? E-com grows for everyone; UPS wins with efficiency.
	•	History Lesson, Noobs: Remember when everyone said Netflix would kill cable? Or Tesla would bury Ford? Nah, incumbents adapt. UPS is investing $1B in EVs and tech to stay ahead – Buffett’s seen this movie before and bets on the survivor. 

TL;DR – Why You Should Buy In Before Tomorrow’s Reveal
Buffett’s buying UPS ‘cause it’s a value beast with a moat, dividends, and growth – announcing tomorrow in the 13F. Bullish despite dips ’cause fundamentals > charts. Amazon? Overhyped threat; UPS adapts and thrives. Target: $100+ by EOY if reveal pumps it.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new stake in troubled insurer UnitedHealth after secretly building the position for two quarters in a row, according to a regulatory filing.

The Omaha-based conglomerate bought more than 5 million shares in the health care firm for a stake worth about $1.6 billion at the end of June. The size is relatively small for Berkshire, whose equity portfolio is worth about $300 billion, so it could be the work of Buffett’s two investing lieutenants Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.

There was much speculation about the mystery position before Thursday with many guessing it would be a defense name. The confidential treatment allowed Berkshire to quietly build up a position and limit price movement without stoking volatility.

The Omaha-based conglomerate bought more than 5 million shares in the health care firm for a stake worth about $1.6 billion at the end of June. The size is relatively small for Berkshire, whose equity portfolio is worth about $300 billion, so it could be the work of Buffett’s two investing lieutenants Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.

There was much speculation about the mystery position before Thursday with many guessing it would be a defense name. The confidential treatment allowed Berkshire to quietly build up a position and limit price movement without stoking volatility.

2025-08-21,How to think of the price floor for Berkshire Hathaway.,"Hi

The price floor of Berkshire Hathaway is the price which the company will come in and start buying back the shares. 

Before 2018, the company bought back shares at 1.2x of Book value. Book value was deemed at that time a good metric to track because it was a holding company of a collection of businesses. In the Owners Manual on the Berkshire Hathaway website, they mentioned Book Value as a then suitable metric. 

From 2018, the company has bought back shares from 1.2x all the way to 1.55x. In 2020 to 2021 where 50bn of Berkshire Stock was purchased, the price to book was around 1.2 to 1.4x.

In 2023 to 2024 where the price to book was 1.5 to 1.6, there were no buybacks.

I therefore think that at around 1.4x of book value, there is high chance that Berkshire will buy back its shares.

( Of course, there is a chance that Buffett has modified the criteria on valuation to use another metric other than Book value, as he mentioned in 2018 that Book value might not be the most accurate measure of fair value for Berkshire Hathaway.)

——

Anyway, the current bookvalue per share of BRK.b is $309.6, at 1.4x the price is 309.6*1.4=433.44. 

I conclude that $433.44 is the price floor.



——

In a previous post a couple of months ago, I gave a number of 470+ as the floor, well I would consider today’s 433.44 to be more accurate. [What changed is the more detailed explanation I received.](https://www.reddit.com/u/raytoei/s/ZBV0FiLB7Y)

2025-08-30,2025 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting: Summary Of The 32 Questions And Answers. (Shared with Permission),"2025 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting: Summary Of The 32 Questions And Answers

(Shared with Permission from Prof David Kass)

**Summary**

* Berkshire Hathaway remains highly patient and disciplined, holding significant cash reserves to seize rare, compelling investment opportunities rather than chasing market trends.
* Greg Abel is confirmed as Warren Buffett's successor, with Buffett expressing full confidence that the company's future prospects are even brighter under Abel's leadership.
* Berkshire's insurance operations, especially GEICO, have seen operational improvements and cost savings but face ongoing challenges from technology, AI, and industry competition.
* Despite headwinds in utilities and insurance, Berkshire's decentralized model, strong balance sheet, and long-term focus position it well for continued growth and resilience.

 **Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting**



May 3, 2025



(Notes taken by Professor David Kass, Department of Finance, Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland)



Approximately 40,000 shareholders attended the annual meeting.



Warren Buffett (94) is on the stage with Greg Abel (63) and Ajit Jain (72)



Buffett mentioned that this was his 60th annual meeting. The previous week, he listened to Apple's quarterly call, which is the only quarterly call that he listens to. ""Tim Cook has made Berkshire a lot more money than I've ever made Berkshire Hathaway.""



Questions were submitted by shareholders to Becky Quick of CNBC, who alternated with the audience.



**Q1. Becky Quick: ""Warren, in a 2003 Fortune article, you argued for import certificates to limit trade deficits and said the import certificates basically amounted to a tariff, but recently you called tariffs an act of economic war... do you see import certificates as distinct from tariffs?**



Buffett: There's no question that tariffs can be an act of war. We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best, and they should do what they do best. My import certificate idea went nowhere. The main thing is that trade should not be a weapon.



**Q2. Audience: Will the Bank of Japan's planned rate hike deter you from further investing in the Japanese stock market?**



Buffett: It's been six years since our Japanese investments. Five trading companies selling at ridiculously low prices. So, I spent a year acquiring them. We got fairly close to the 10% limit that we told the companies we would never exceed without their permission. We did ask them whether that limit could be relaxed, and it is in the process of being relaxed somewhat. In the next 50 years, we will not give a thought to selling these positions. Japan's record has been extraordinary. They talk primarily with Greg.



Abel: We have about $20 billion invested in these companies. I'd rather have $100 billion than $20 billion.



**Q3. Quick: Berkshire holds over $300 billion in cash, representing 27% of assets compared to the 13% average over the last 25 years. Is this a decision to de-risk in response to high market valuations? Or is it also a deliberate effort to position Berkshire's balance sheet for a smoother transition to Greg Abel, providing him with maximum flexibility and a clean slate for future capital allocation decisions?**



Buffett: I wouldn't do anything nearly so noble as to withhold investing myself just so that Greg could look good later on. We would spend $100 billion if something is offered that makes sense to us, that we understand, offers good value, and where we don't worry about losing money. We would rather have conditions develop where we would have $50 billion in cash rather than $335 billion in treasuries. We have made a lot of money by not wanting to be fully invested at all times. Things get extraordinarily attractive very occasionally. The long-term trend is up. I don't know when, but we will be bombarded with offerings that we'll be glad we have cash for.



**Q4. Audience: Why are you still buying stocks instead of more property? Is value investing facing new challenges in today's environment?**



Buffett: In real estate, it is so much harder than stocks in terms of negotiation of deals, time spent, and the involvement of multiple parties in ownership. Charlie did more real estate. He enjoyed real estate transactions. But he was playing a game that was interesting to him. There is just so much more opportunity, at least in the United States, that presents itself in the security market than in real estate. On the New York Stock Exchange, you can do billions of dollars' worth of business, totally anonymous, and you can do it in 5 minutes. In real estate, when you make a deal with a distressed lender, that's just the beginning. Then people start negotiating more things. We have seen some huge failures in real estate, such as Zeckendorf in the 1960s and Reichmann with the Canary Wharf buildings in London.



**Q5. Quick: As AI systems become more capable and harder to interpret, how do you see that affecting the insurance industry's ability to assess price and transfer risk?**



Jain: AI is going to be a real game-changer. We are not very good at being the fastest or the first mover. Our approach is more to wait and see until the opportunity crystallizes.



Buffett: I wouldn't trade everything that's developed in AI in the next 10 years for Ajit.



**Q6. Audience: A question about Berkshire's acquisition of Portillo's Hot Dogs in Chicago.**



Abel: A friend just called. Portillo's is owned by a private equity firm called Berkshire Partners (not Berkshire Hathaway).



**Q7. Quick: Is the U.S. entering a period of fundamental change?**



Buffett: America has been undergoing significant change ever since it was developed. We've gone through all kinds of things - great recessions, world wars, the development of the atomic bomb.



**Q8. Audience: How has acting fast benefited you?**



Buffett: There are times when you have to act fast. We were offered a business at a bargain price - $6 million. It had $2 million of cash, a $2 million piece of property on Market Street in Philadelphia, and it was making $2 million a year pre-tax. We bought the company. You have to be willing to hang up after 5 seconds, and you have to be willing to say yes after 5 seconds. You can't be filled with self-doubt in this business. One of the great pleasures in this business is having people trust you. That's really why I work at 94 when I've got more money than anybody could count.



**Q9. Quick: What changes has Todd Combs made at GEICO?**



Jain: Todd has done a great job in turning around the operations. When he took over, there were two major issues that GEICO was behind its competitors on. First is matching rate with risk, and the second telematics. We were at the bottom of the list in telematics about five or six years ago. Our telematics at GEICO is about as good as anyone else's today. In terms of matching rate to risk, we have caught up with our competitors. Todd also reduced the workforce by 20,000 from 50,000 down to 30,000, which translates to at least $2 billion per year in savings. GEICO's 80 combined ratio translates to the largest profit anyone is making on the underwriting side in the personal automobile business. We need to do a lot more in technology. AI is going to be a big force, and we need to be in a state of readiness.



Buffett: The auto insurance policy is by far the largest item in the property casualty business.



Jain: GEICO provides $29 billion float.



Buffett: $29 billion to work with for nothing. Nobody likes to buy insurance, but they sure like to drive. You get a few breaks in life in terms of people you meet who just change your life dramatically (Lorimar Davidson at GEICO). You just get lucky in life, and you want to take advantage of your luck.



**Q10. Audience: What specifically about Greg Abel makes him your preferred successor?**



Buffett: We've got a wonderful group of businesses. You really want to work at something you enjoy. I've had five bosses in my life, and I liked every one of them. I'd rather work for myself than anybody else. But if you find people that are wonderful to work with, that's the place to go. You want to find what you love. Don't worry about starting salaries. There are certain jobs you shouldn't take.



Abel: I couldn't be more humbled and honored to be in this role.



**Q11: Quick: As the U.S. dollar quickly loses value in relation to other foreign currencies in 2025, is Berkshire Hathaway taking steps to minimize this currency risk and its impact on quarterly and annual earnings? Berkshire currently borrows in Japanese yen to offset its currency risk and its Japanese stock investments. In the future, will you invest in foreign currency-denominated assets unhedged?**



Buffett: The Japanese situation is different because we intend to stay long with that position, and the funding situation is so cheap. We've owned lots of securities in foreign currencies. We do nothing in terms of impact on quarterly and annual earnings. The natural course of government is to make currency worthless over time. We only made one big currency play. We went long 12 other currencies (that means we're short the dollar). We held that position for a couple of years and made several billions of dollars on it.



**Q12. Audience: What advice would you give to government and business leaders of emerging markets like Mongolia to attract institutional investors?**



Buffett: We don't really want to go into any country where we think there's a significant probability of runaway inflation. The chances are we won't find anything in Mongolia that fits our size requirements.



**Q13. Quick: In recent years, large private equity firms like Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR have been trying to replicate the model that Berkshire pioneered decades ago. What impact have they had on Berkshire's insurance operations?**



Jain: Private equity firms have come into this space, and we are no longer competitive in the space. In the last 3-4 years, I don't think we've done a single deal.



Buffett: I think there are people who want to copy Berkshire's model, but there is no property casualty company that can basically replicate Berkshire.



**Q14. Audience: What are some pivotal lessons you learned early in your career?**



Buffett: Who you associate with is just enormously important. I would try to be associated with smart people where I could learn a lot from them, and I would try to look for something that I would do if I didn't need the money. If somebody's going to be helpful to you, you want to try to figure out ways to be helpful to them. Greg doesn't need the money, Ajit doesn't need the money, but they enjoy what they do. The best manager I ever knew was Tom Murphy Sr., who lived to be almost 98. You'd want to work for Tom Murphy. I think a happy person lives longer.



**Q15: Quick: Has the recent market volatility presented Berkshire with opportunities? You mentioned that Berkshire almost invested $10 billion.**



Buffett: What has happened in the last 30-45 days, 100 days, whatever this period has been, is really nothing. There have been three times since we acquired Berkshire that Berkshire has gone down 50% in a fairly short period of time. The Dow Jones Average was at 381 in September of 1929 and got down to 42. That's going from 100 to 11. This has not been a dramatic bear market of anything of the sort. When I was born on August 30, 1930, the Dow Jones was at 240, and it went to 41. You will see a period in the next 20 years that will be a ""hair-curler"" compared to anything we have seen before. That just happens periodically. The world makes big mistakes, and surprises happen in dramatic ways. The stock market is a good place if you have the proper temperament for it and a terrible place if you get frightened by markets that decline and get excited when stock markets go up. I know people have emotions, but you've got to check them at the door when you invest.



**Q16: Audience: Have you ever encountered any major setbacks in your life, and how did you overcome them?**



Buffett: Everybody gets setbacks. Some people have particularly bad luck in that respect. Some people get extraordinarily bad luck, and other people get extraordinarily good luck. I would focus on the things that have been good in your life rather than the bad things that happen, because bad things do happen. Charlie and I never really exercised that much or did anything.



**Q17. Quick: Would autonomous vehicles result in disruption risk to GEICO's auto insurance business? Would auto insurance today become product liability insurance for autonomous vehicles?**



Jain: Most insurance that is sold revolves around operator errors - how often they happen, how severe they are, and therefore, what premium to charge. To the extent these new self-driving cars are safer and involved in fewer accidents that insurance will be less required. Instead, it will be substituted by product liability.



Buffett: We expect change in all of our businesses. The world changes. Auto insurance will change.



Jain: The shift to product liability will provide protection for accidents that take place because of an error in product design. The number of accidents will drop. But the cost of repair will go up significantly because of the amount of technology in the car. How those two variables interact with each other in terms of the total cost of providing insurance is an open issue.



Buffett: When I walked into GEICO's office in 1951, the average price of a policy was $40 a year. Now it is $2,000, depending on location and other factors. During the same time, the number of people killed in auto accidents has fallen from six per hundred million miles driven to a little over one. The car has become incredibly safer, and it costs 50 times as much to buy an insurance policy. The auto insurance industry has been a huge growth industry. It is unprofitable to write homeowners insurance in Nebraska, even after the premium has doubled in the last 10 years. We try to get into high-probability things.



Abel: Warren, as we approach the break, would you like to address the operating earnings?



Buffett: Yes. We released our 10-Q this morning. Our insurance underwriting income was down dramatically for the first quarter. Prices are down this year, and risks are up this year. But we do have unusual advantages in the insurance business that can't really be replicated by our competition. We just announced within the last 24 hours that we, Zurich, and Chubb have arranged a joint operation to be the writer of really large sums that very few people can do. The railroad is earning a little more than last year, but it is not earning what it should be earning at the present time. The energy company last year was having problems, and those are absent this year.



Abel: Of our 49 businesses that we measure closely, 21 were up and 28 were down,



Buffett: We hold a lot more in cash and treasuries than I would like, but that is simply a question of when opportunities occur. If you get real opportunities every five or six years, you have to be patient. Our float continues to grow.



Jain: Clearly, we are heads and shoulders above anyone else. Our cost of float is negative 2.2%. That means we've got the float plus somebody's given us 2.2% of cash.



Buffett: It's like running a bank where people leave their money with you and you pay a minus 2.2%. We haven't made any share repurchases so far this year. There is a 1% tax for repurchasing shares. We pay more than you do. Tim Cook has done a wonderful job running Apple, but he spent about $100 billion in a year repurchasing shares, and there's a 1% charge attached to that now. That's a billion dollars a year. We will only buy our shares if we think that are almost certainly underpriced.



**AFTERNOON SESSION**



**Q18. Audience: Greg, what have you learned from Warren, and Warren, what have you learned from Greg?**



Abel: I want to be remembered as a great father and a great coach. I coach hockey and baseball and want to give back to kids at a young age. Warren is truly a great teacher. Warren focused on understanding the business and the risks around it.



Buffett: I spend more time looking at balance sheets than I do income statements. You learn more from balance sheets. Charlie was a remarkable teacher. My dad was an incredible teacher.



**Q19. Quick: What are Greg's views on capital allocation, particularly into new businesses?**



Abel: We will have a fortress of a balance sheet. We have a significant amount of cash right now, which is an enormous asset. We will deploy it well. It allows us to weather difficult times and not be dependent on anybody. With the allocation of capital comes management of risk and understanding risk. We will have opportunities to acquire whole businesses and parts of businesses.



Buffett: There are certain really major investment situations where we have capital like nobody else has in the private system. We have particular know-how in the whole generation and transmission arena.



**Q20. Audience: I'm 14 years old. What piece of knowledge should I learn so you would hire me in the future?**



Abel: Hard work takes all of us a long way in life.



Buffett: Keep a lot of curiosity and read a lot.



**Q21. Quick: What is your strategy on how to protect our company from future liabilities due to wildfires blamed on our electric utility companies out west?**



Buffett: We made some mistakes in the past when we bought PacifiCorp in 2005. We made a mistake by not carving it up into the seven states that we were buying.



Abel: The reality is the risk around wildfires. We can't eliminate the risk, but we can reduce it. We try to make sure we are not causing the fire. In 2020, in PacifiCorp, we didn't de-energize the system as the fire was approaching. We should try to ensure the fire does not spread further.



Quick: Doesn't that open you up to other risk. If you shut down your system, a hospital gets shut down, somebody dies?



Abel: You earn a very set return for taking on a very defined risk associated with an asset, and this has gone well beyond that. We don't earn the type of returns, nor can you earn a large enough return to take on these risks.



Buffett: There are some problems that can't be solved. If you're in something where you're going to lose, the big thing to do is quit.



Abel: Our largest challenge is the 2020 wildfire. The fire burnt into our service territory, and we became responsible for that fire effectively through the courts. We can't be the insurer of last resort. We just can't be responsible for everything that happens in a state.



Buffett: It is important that the United States have an intelligent energy policy.



**Q22. Audience: A shareholder asks to meet with Warren Buffett for one hour.**



Buffett: If I grant an hour to everybody of the 40,000 here, we'll have an interesting time the rest of my life. He then describes how, when he was young, he would drive around the country visiting small companies where CEOs would speak to him to recommend which stock they would recommend of their competitors and which stock they would short.



**Q23. Quick: A shareholder was happy that Berkshire acquired 100% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. It was done in two steps. The second larger transaction represented a 44% reduction in valuation in just two years. What factors contributed to this difference?**



Buffett: We don't know how much we'll lose out of PacifiCorp and decisions that are made. There are a lot of states that, so far, have been very good to operate in, and there are some now that are rat poison, as Charlie would say to operate in. It was an extrapolation of a societal trend. We're not in the mood to sell any business. But Berkshire Hathaway Energy is worth considerably less money than it was two years ago, based on societal factors. The public utility business is not as good a business as it was a couple of years ago. We'd like to see public utilities do well, but our responsibilities are to the shareholders of Berkshire.



**Q24. Audience: What is your estimate of Berkshire's earning power in the latest fiscal year?**



Buffett: Our underlying earning power was affected negatively by what happened in the utility field. Our earning power was not enlarged by any large acquisitions. If Berkshire went down 50% next week, I would regard that as a fantastic opportunity. Berkshire will increase its earning power over time as we retain money. In the investment business, everything isn't properly appraised, and the more fearful other people get, the better your opportunities get.



**Q25. Quick: With all of the big cap technology companies announcing massive capital investment endeavors around AI, have your rethought your comment in 2017 that the companies don't need any money?**



Buffett: Coca-Cola does not require a lot of capital to sell the syrup or concentrate. But the bottling business costs real money. We've got businesses that take very little capital that make really high returns on capital. Property casualty insurance is a rare business because you need capital as a guarantee fund, but you can use it to buy other low capital intensive businesses. Apple has not really needed any capital over the years, and it's repurchased shares with a dramatic reduction. People in the money management business get very rich because they get an override on other people's capital. Investment management is a very good game because other people put up the capital, and you charge them for the capital, whether they do well or not, and then you charge them a lot more if they do well. The trick in life is to get somebody else's capital and get an override on it. I did it for 12 years. The one difference that Charlie and I did is we put all our own money into it. So we really did share the losses with our own capital, but we got an override on other people's capital. Capitalism in the United States has succeeded.



**Q26. Audience: What high school class or activity helped influence you to become the greatest investor of all time?**



Buffett: The teachers you get in your life have an incredible impression on you. I've learned from certain employers. I was really lucky my dad was in the investment business. I would go down on Saturday and read the books. I read every book on investments in the Omaha public library. Having curiosity and finding sympathetic teachers is very useful. I was lucky to find something that fit me very early on. I just spent hours and hours on investing. Minds are really different. People have really different talents. People who teach, in general, love having a young student who's actually really interested in the subject, and they'll spend extra time with you. I ran into that. I had Graham and Dodd at Columbia. Dave Dodd treated me like a son. Look around at what really fascinates you. I wouldn't try to be somebody else. I've had at least 10 people that have had huge impacts on my life. A number of people really like helping younger people.



**Q27. Quick: Will the net benefit of DOGE be positive or negative for the long-term health of the United States?**



Buffett: Bureaucracies can be run better. Government is the ultimate. It really does not have any checks on it. They can print currency. We have a fiscal deficit that is unsustainable over a very long period of time. The U.S has a revenue/expenditure gap of 7% when probably a 3% gap is sustainable. Congress does not seem good at lowering this gap.



**Q28. Audience: Imagine it's 1776 and you are sitting alongside Benjamin Franklin. What core economic principles would you advocate?**



Buffett: I would tell him to try to design a system that doesn't invent too many things that can destroy the planet. There was no alternative to us developing the atom bomb, but the expansion of the number of people that have the ability from one to eight, and nine probably pretty soon with Iran - that's a mistake that society just could not afford to make. Solving the problem with nine variables instead of simply one. The United States is the best place, and this is the best time to be alive. The question is, how do you keep it, and how do you improve it? Fundamental to all of it is having a currency that does not get debased.



**Q29. Quick: Greg, Mr. Buffett has a hands-off approach to managing the operating subsidiaries. How would you describe you're approach?**



Abel: My style would be to have questions and comments around their business, their frameworks. They run them autonomously, and that remains in place. We want to make sure the right folks are talking and figuring out how we can benefit from the prior experiences.



Buffett: It's working way better with Greg than with me because I just didn't want to work as hard. Greg can do better at many things. Many people want to be managed, need help in being managed. Some don't. Some you just leave alone. We've had managers it would have been crazy to start giving instructions to because they just quit. And I wouldn't blame them. People want a manager that they admire.



**Q30. Audience: Berkshire Hathaway is the second largest utility provider in the United States, and its coal fleet is the dirtiest in the nation. There is no concrete plan to retire coal and fully transition to renewable energy. What about the consequences of climate change caused by companies like Berkshire?**



Abel: In the early 2000s, we made the decision to build the largest wind project in the US in Iowa. We deployed $16 billion in Iowa associated with renewable energy, consistent with what our state wanted us to do. We have had the opportunity to retire five of the 10 coal units. We've been able to maintain our rates. They're some of the lowest in the country, but the reality is we still need those five coal units to keep the system stable. Our utilities implement policy consistent with the needs of their stakeholders, their customers, and respecting what's required by any of the federal standards.



**Q31. Quick: What ultimately led to the end of your healthcare venture with JP Morgan and Amazon?**



Buffett: We spend close to 20% of GDP on health. People generally like their doctor, didn't like the system. But in the end, JP Morgan and Amazon and Berkshire were not going to have any effect on changing the 20%. Other countries spend 6 or 7% of GDP. The system was too entrenched to really do much in the way of change. Our costs were far higher than Canada, France, or Britain, and to some extent, we were subsidizing the rest of the world. People would come to the United States to do the really unusual or challenging aspects of health in terms of operations. When you have 20% of GDP going into a given industry, it will have political power. We are a very rich country. So we can do things other countries can't do. It's easy to spend money, and it's hard to cut people's receipts. It's so much better to live here than it was 100 years ago or 200 years ago.



**Q32. Audience: You mentioned that Greg will be in charge of capital allocation in the future. Is it easier for a business operator to be an investor or for an investor to be a business operator?**



Buffett: It's a lot tougher to be an operator. It's easier to sit in a room like I do and play around with money. It is an easier life. I've been able to choose my friends. I've never had to work for anybody that I didn't admire. I had 5 different people I worked for, and they were fantastic. I've been able to choose what I do with my day as compared to being a business operator. I can run the kind of company I want to run, and that's an extraordinary luxury.



Buffett: The time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year-end. I would still hang around and could conceivably be useful in a few cases. But the final word would be what Greg said, in operations, in capital deployment, whatever it might be. The board would be more welcome to giving him more authority on large acquisitions probably if they knew I was around. I have no intention, zero, of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway - it will be given away. The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg's management than mine. Thanks for coming. The enthusiasm shown by the audience's response can be interpreted in two ways. But I'll take It as positive. Thank you.



**Meeting Adjourned**



In conclusion, the highlight of the meeting occurred at the end when Warren Buffett announced he was stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on December 31. Greg Abel would then become CEO. Although the timing of this announcement was a surprise, Buffett will be 95 on August 30, and Abel had previously been designated by Buffett to succeed him. Abel has been with Berkshire for over 25 years and has been successfully running all of Berkshire's non-insurance operations since January 2018 as Vice Chairman.



In my opinion, the outlook for Berkshire is very bright, with its most important business, Geico, having been turned around with price matching risk more closely and telematics being successfully introduced.



Berkshire's $20 billion investments in the five Japanese trading companies over the past six years is working out very well. Its over $300 billion in cash should enable Berkshire to take advantage of the next sharp stock market decline and make investments at much lower prices.



Since its May 3 annual meeting, Berkshire's shares have declined by 14%, underperforming the S&P 500 (+12%) by 26 percentage points. This has resulted in Berkshire now trading close to its historical price-to-book value of 1.5, which presents an attractive entry point for investors.

* Greg Abel is confirmed as Warren Buffett's successor, with Buffett expressing full confidence that the company's future prospects are even brighter under Abel's leadership.
* Berkshire's insurance operations, especially GEICO, have seen operational improvements and cost savings but face ongoing challenges from technology, AI, and industry competition.
* Despite headwinds in utilities and insurance, Berkshire's decentralized model, strong balance sheet, and long-term focus position it well for continued growth and resilience.

 **Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting**



May 3, 2025



(Notes taken by Professor David Kass, Department of Finance, Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland)



Approximately 40,000 shareholders attended the annual meeting.



Warren Buffett (94) is on the stage with Greg Abel (63) and Ajit Jain (72)



Buffett mentioned that this was his 60th annual meeting. The previous week, he listened to Apple's quarterly call, which is the only quarterly call that he listens to. ""Tim Cook has made Berkshire a lot more money than I've ever made Berkshire Hathaway.""



Questions were submitted by shareholders to Becky Quick of CNBC, who alternated with the audience.



**Q1. Becky Quick: ""Warren, in a 2003 Fortune article, you argued for import certificates to limit trade deficits and said the import certificates basically amounted to a tariff, but recently you called tariffs an act of economic war... do you see import certificates as distinct from tariffs?**



Buffett: There's no question that tariffs can be an act of war. We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best, and they should do what they do best. My import certificate idea went nowhere. The main thing is that trade should not be a weapon.



**Q2. Audience: Will the Bank of Japan's planned rate hike deter you from further investing in the Japanese stock market?**



Buffett: It's been six years since our Japanese investments. Five trading companies selling at ridiculously low prices. So, I spent a year acquiring them. We got fairly close to the 10% limit that we told the companies we would never exceed without their permission. We did ask them whether that limit could be relaxed, and it is in the process of being relaxed somewhat. In the next 50 years, we will not give a thought to selling these positions. Japan's record has been extraordinary. They talk primarily with Greg.



Abel: We have about $20 billion invested in these companies. I'd rather have $100 billion than $20 billion.



**Q3. Quick: Berkshire holds over $300 billion in cash, representing 27% of assets compared to the 13% average over the last 25 years. Is this a decision to de-risk in response to high market valuations? Or is it also a deliberate effort to position Berkshire's balance sheet for a smoother transition to Greg Abel, providing him with maximum flexibility and a clean slate for future capital allocation decisions?**



Buffett: I wouldn't do anything nearly so noble as to withhold investing myself just so that Greg could look good later on. We would spend $100 billion if something is offered that makes sense to us, that we understand, offers good value, and where we don't worry about losing money. We would rather have conditions develop where we would have $50 billion in cash rather than $335 billion in treasuries. We have made a lot of money by not wanting to be fully invested at all times. Things get extraordinarily attractive very occasionally. The long-term trend is up. I don't know when, but we will be bombarded with offerings that we'll be glad we have cash for.



**Q4. Audience: Why are you still buying stocks instead of more property? Is value investing facing new challenges in today's environment?**



Buffett: In real estate, it is so much harder than stocks in terms of negotiation of deals, time spent, and the involvement of multiple parties in ownership. Charlie did more real estate. He enjoyed real estate transactions. But he was playing a game that was interesting to him. There is just so much more opportunity, at least in the United States, that presents itself in the security market than in real estate. On the New York Stock Exchange, you can do billions of dollars' worth of business, totally anonymous, and you can do it in 5 minutes. In real estate, when you make a deal with a distressed lender, that's just the beginning. Then people start negotiating more things. We have seen some huge failures in real estate, such as Zeckendorf in the 1960s and Reichmann with the Canary Wharf buildings in London.



**Q5. Quick: As AI systems become more capable and harder to interpret, how do you see that affecting the insurance industry's ability to assess price and transfer risk?**



Jain: AI is going to be a real game-changer. We are not very good at being the fastest or the first mover. Our approach is more to wait and see until the opportunity crystallizes.



Buffett: I wouldn't trade everything that's developed in AI in the next 10 years for Ajit.



**Q6. Audience: A question about Berkshire's acquisition of Portillo's Hot Dogs in Chicago.**



Abel: A friend just called. Portillo's is owned by a private equity firm called Berkshire Partners (not Berkshire Hathaway).



**Q7. Quick: Is the U.S. entering a period of fundamental change?**



Buffett: America has been undergoing significant change ever since it was developed. We've gone through all kinds of things - great recessions, world wars, the development of the atomic bomb.



**Q8. Audience: How has acting fast benefited you?**



Buffett: There are times when you have to act fast. We were offered a business at a bargain price - $6 million. It had $2 million of cash, a $2 million piece of property on Market Street in Philadelphia, and it was making $2 million a year pre-tax. We bought the company. You have to be willing to hang up after 5 seconds, and you have to be willing to say yes after 5 seconds. You can't be filled with self-doubt in this business. One of the great pleasures in this business is having people trust you. That's really why I work at 94 when I've got more money than anybody could count.



**Q9. Quick: What changes has Todd Combs made at GEICO?**



Jain: Todd has done a great job in turning around the operations. When he took over, there were two major issues that GEICO was behind its competitors on. First is matching rate with risk, and the second telematics. We were at the bottom of the list in telematics about five or six years ago. Our telematics at GEICO is about as good as anyone else's today. In terms of matching rate to risk, we have caught up with our competitors. Todd also reduced the workforce by 20,000 from 50,000 down to 30,000, which translates to at least $2 billion per year in savings. GEICO's 80 combined ratio translates to the largest profit anyone is making on the underwriting side in the personal automobile business. We need to do a lot more in technology. AI is going to be a big force, and we need to be in a state of readiness.



Buffett: The auto insurance policy is by far the largest item in the property casualty business.



Jain: GEICO provides $29 billion float.



Buffett: $29 billion to work with for nothing. Nobody likes to buy insurance, but they sure like to drive. You get a few breaks in life in terms of people you meet who just change your life dramatically (Lorimar Davidson at GEICO). You just get lucky in life, and you want to take advantage of your luck.



**Q10. Audience: What specifically about Greg Abel makes him your preferred successor?**



Buffett: We've got a wonderful group of businesses. You really want to work at something you enjoy. I've had five bosses in my life, and I liked every one of them. I'd rather work for myself than anybody else. But if you find people that are wonderful to work with, that's the place to go. You want to find what you love. Don't worry about starting salaries. There are certain jobs you shouldn't take.



Abel: I couldn't be more humbled and honored to be in this role.



**Q11: Quick: As the U.S. dollar quickly loses value in relation to other foreign currencies in 2025, is Berkshire Hathaway taking steps to minimize this currency risk and its impact on quarterly and annual earnings? Berkshire currently borrows in Japanese yen to offset its currency risk and its Japanese stock investments. In the future, will you invest in foreign currency-denominated assets unhedged?**



Buffett: The Japanese situation is different because we intend to stay long with that position, and the funding situation is so cheap. We've owned lots of securities in foreign currencies. We do nothing in terms of impact on quarterly and annual earnings. The natural course of government is to make currency worthless over time. We only made one big currency play. We went long 12 other currencies (that means we're short the dollar). We held that position for a couple of years and made several billions of dollars on it.



**Q12. Audience: What advice would you give to government and business leaders of emerging markets like Mongolia to attract institutional investors?**



Buffett: We don't really want to go into any country where we think there's a significant probability of runaway inflation. The chances are we won't find anything in Mongolia that fits our size requirements.



**Q13. Quick: In recent years, large private equity firms like Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR have been trying to replicate the model that Berkshire pioneered decades ago. What impact have they had on Berkshire's insurance operations?**



Jain: Private equity firms have come into this space, and we are no longer competitive in the space. In the last 3-4 years, I don't think we've done a single deal.



Buffett: I think there are people who want to copy Berkshire's model, but there is no property casualty company that can basically replicate Berkshire.



**Q14. Audience: What are some pivotal lessons you learned early in your career?**



Buffett: Who you associate with is just enormously important. I would try to be associated with smart people where I could learn a lot from them, and I would try to look for something that I would do if I didn't need the money. If somebody's going to be helpful to you, you want to try to figure out ways to be helpful to them. Greg doesn't need the money, Ajit doesn't need the money, but they enjoy what they do. The best manager I ever knew was Tom Murphy Sr., who lived to be almost 98. You'd want to work for Tom Murphy. I think a happy person lives longer.



**Q15: Quick: Has the recent market volatility presented Berkshire with opportunities? You mentioned that Berkshire almost invested $10 billion.**



Buffett: What has happened in the last 30-45 days, 100 days, whatever this period has been, is really nothing. There have been three times since we acquired Berkshire that Berkshire has gone down 50% in a fairly short period of time. The Dow Jones Average was at 381 in September of 1929 and got down to 42. That's going from 100 to 11. This has not been a dramatic bear market of anything of the sort. When I was born on August 30, 1930, the Dow Jones was at 240, and it went to 41. You will see a period in the next 20 years that will be a ""hair-curler"" compared to anything we have seen before. That just happens periodically. The world makes big mistakes, and surprises happen in dramatic ways. The stock market is a good place if you have the proper temperament for it and a terrible place if you get frightened by markets that decline and get excited when stock markets go up. I know people have emotions, but you've got to check them at the door when you invest.



**Q16: Audience: Have you ever encountered any major setbacks in your life, and how did you overcome them?**



Buffett: Everybody gets setbacks. Some people have particularly bad luck in that respect. Some people get extraordinarily bad luck, and other people get extraordinarily good luck. I would focus on the things that have been good in your life rather than the bad things that happen, because bad things do happen. Charlie and I never really exercised that much or did anything.



**Q17. Quick: Would autonomous vehicles result in disruption risk to GEICO's auto insurance business? Would auto insurance today become product liability insurance for autonomous vehicles?**



Jain: Most insurance that is sold revolves around operator errors - how often they happen, how severe they are, and therefore, what premium to charge. To the extent these new self-driving cars are safer and involved in fewer accidents that insurance will be less required. Instead, it will be substituted by product liability.



Buffett: We expect change in all of our businesses. The world changes. Auto insurance will change.



Jain: The shift to product liability will provide protection for accidents that take place because of an error in product design. The number of accidents will drop. But the cost of repair will go up significantly because of the amount of technology in the car. How those two variables interact with each other in terms of the total cost of providing insurance is an open issue.



Buffett: When I walked into GEICO's office in 1951, the average price of a policy was $40 a year. Now it is $2,000, depending on location and other factors. During the same time, the number of people killed in auto accidents has fallen from six per hundred million miles driven to a little over one. The car has become incredibly safer, and it costs 50 times as much to buy an insurance policy. The auto insurance industry has been a huge growth industry. It is unprofitable to write homeowners insurance in Nebraska, even after the premium has doubled in the last 10 years. We try to get into high-probability things.



Abel: Warren, as we approach the break, would you like to address the operating earnings?



Buffett: Yes. We released our 10-Q this morning. Our insurance underwriting income was down dramatically for the first quarter. Prices are down this year, and risks are up this year. But we do have unusual advantages in the insurance business that can't really be replicated by our competition. We just announced within the last 24 hours that we, Zurich, and Chubb have arranged a joint operation to be the writer of really large sums that very few people can do. The railroad is earning a little more than last year, but it is not earning what it should be earning at the present time. The energy company last year was having problems, and those are absent this year.



Abel: Of our 49 businesses that we measure closely, 21 were up and 28 were down,



Buffett: We hold a lot more in cash and treasuries than I would like, but that is simply a question of when opportunities occur. If you get real opportunities every five or six years, you have to be patient. Our float continues to grow.



Jain: Clearly, we are heads and shoulders above anyone else. Our cost of float is negative 2.2%. That means we've got the float plus somebody's given us 2.2% of cash.



Buffett: It's like running a bank where people leave their money with you and you pay a minus 2.2%. We haven't made any share repurchases so far this year. There is a 1% tax for repurchasing shares. We pay more than you do. Tim Cook has done a wonderful job running Apple, but he spent about $100 billion in a year repurchasing shares, and there's a 1% charge attached to that now. That's a billion dollars a year. We will only buy our shares if we think that are almost certainly underpriced.



**AFTERNOON SESSION**



**Q18. Audience: Greg, what have you learned from Warren, and Warren, what have you learned from Greg?**



Abel: I want to be remembered as a great father and a great coach. I coach hockey and baseball and want to give back to kids at a young age. Warren is truly a great teacher. Warren focused on understanding the business and the risks around it.



Buffett: I spend more time looking at balance sheets than I do income statements. You learn more from balance sheets. Charlie was a remarkable teacher. My dad was an incredible teacher.



**Q19. Quick: What are Greg's views on capital allocation, particularly into new businesses?**



Abel: We will have a fortress of a balance sheet. We have a significant amount of cash right now, which is an enormous asset. We will deploy it well. It allows us to weather difficult times and not be dependent on anybody. With the allocation of capital comes management of risk and understanding risk. We will have opportunities to acquire whole businesses and parts of businesses.



Buffett: There are certain really major investment situations where we have capital like nobody else has in the private system. We have particular know-how in the whole generation and transmission arena.



**Q20. Audience: I'm 14 years old. What piece of knowledge should I learn so you would hire me in the future?**



Abel: Hard work takes all of us a long way in life.



Buffett: Keep a lot of curiosity and read a lot.



**Q21. Quick: What is your strategy on how to protect our company from future liabilities due to wildfires blamed on our electric utility companies out west?**



Buffett: We made some mistakes in the past when we bought PacifiCorp in 2005. We made a mistake by not carving it up into the seven states that we were buying.



Abel: The reality is the risk around wildfires. We can't eliminate the risk, but we can reduce it. We try to make sure we are not causing the fire. In 2020, in PacifiCorp, we didn't de-energize the system as the fire was approaching. We should try to ensure the fire does not spread further.



Quick: Doesn't that open you up to other risk. If you shut down your system, a hospital gets shut down, somebody dies?



Abel: You earn a very set return for taking on a very defined risk associated with an asset, and this has gone well beyond that. We don't earn the type of returns, nor can you earn a large enough return to take on these risks.



Buffett: There are some problems that can't be solved. If you're in something where you're going to lose, the big thing to do is quit.



Abel: Our largest challenge is the 2020 wildfire. The fire burnt into our service territory, and we became responsible for that fire effectively through the courts. We can't be the insurer of last resort. We just can't be responsible for everything that happens in a state.



Buffett: It is important that the United States have an intelligent energy policy.



**Q22. Audience: A shareholder asks to meet with Warren Buffett for one hour.**



Buffett: If I grant an hour to everybody of the 40,000 here, we'll have an interesting time the rest of my life. He then describes how, when he was young, he would drive around the country visiting small companies where CEOs would speak to him to recommend which stock they would recommend of their competitors and which stock they would short.



**Q23. Quick: A shareholder was happy that Berkshire acquired 100% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. It was done in two steps. The second larger transaction represented a 44% reduction in valuation in just two years. What factors contributed to this difference?**



Buffett: We don't know how much we'll lose out of PacifiCorp and decisions that are made. There are a lot of states that, so far, have been very good to operate in, and there are some now that are rat poison, as Charlie would say to operate in. It was an extrapolation of a societal trend. We're not in the mood to sell any business. But Berkshire Hathaway Energy is worth considerably less money than it was two years ago, based on societal factors. The public utility business is not as good a business as it was a couple of years ago. We'd like to see public utilities do well, but our responsibilities are to the shareholders of Berkshire.



**Q24. Audience: What is your estimate of Berkshire's earning power in the latest fiscal year?**



Buffett: Our underlying earning power was affected negatively by what happened in the utility field. Our earning power was not enlarged by any large acquisitions. If Berkshire went down 50% next week, I would regard that as a fantastic opportunity. Berkshire will increase its earning power over time as we retain money. In the investment business, everything isn't properly appraised, and the more fearful other people get, the better your opportunities get.



**Q25. Quick: With all of the big cap technology companies announcing massive capital investment endeavors around AI, have your rethought your comment in 2017 that the companies don't need any money?**



Buffett: Coca-Cola does not require a lot of capital to sell the syrup or concentrate. But the bottling business costs real money. We've got businesses that take very little capital that make really high returns on capital. Property casualty insurance is a rare business because you need capital as a guarantee fund, but you can use it to buy other low capital intensive businesses. Apple has not really needed any capital over the years, and it's repurchased shares with a dramatic reduction. People in the money management business get very rich because they get an override on other people's capital. Investment management is a very good game because other people put up the capital, and you charge them for the capital, whether they do well or not, and then you charge them a lot more if they do well. The trick in life is to get somebody else's capital and get an override on it. I did it for 12 years. The one difference that Charlie and I did is we put all our own money into it. So we really did share the losses with our own capital, but we got an override on other people's capital. Capitalism in the United States has succeeded.



**Q26. Audience: What high school class or activity helped influence you to become the greatest investor of all time?**



Buffett: The teachers you get in your life have an incredible impression on you. I've learned from certain employers. I was really lucky my dad was in the investment business. I would go down on Saturday and read the books. I read every book on investments in the Omaha public library. Having curiosity and finding sympathetic teachers is very useful. I was lucky to find something that fit me very early on. I just spent hours and hours on investing. Minds are really different. People have really different talents. People who teach, in general, love having a young student who's actually really interested in the subject, and they'll spend extra time with you. I ran into that. I had Graham and Dodd at Columbia. Dave Dodd treated me like a son. Look around at what really fascinates you. I wouldn't try to be somebody else. I've had at least 10 people that have had huge impacts on my life. A number of people really like helping younger people.



**Q27. Quick: Will the net benefit of DOGE be positive or negative for the long-term health of the United States?**



Buffett: Bureaucracies can be run better. Government is the ultimate. It really does not have any checks on it. They can print currency. We have a fiscal deficit that is unsustainable over a very long period of time. The U.S has a revenue/expenditure gap of 7% when probably a 3% gap is sustainable. Congress does not seem good at lowering this gap.



**Q28. Audience: Imagine it's 1776 and you are sitting alongside Benjamin Franklin. What core economic principles would you advocate?**



Buffett: I would tell him to try to design a system that doesn't invent too many things that can destroy the planet. There was no alternative to us developing the atom bomb, but the expansion of the number of people that have the ability from one to eight, and nine probably pretty soon with Iran - that's a mistake that society just could not afford to make. Solving the problem with nine variables instead of simply one. The United States is the best place, and this is the best time to be alive. The question is, how do you keep it, and how do you improve it? Fundamental to all of it is having a currency that does not get debased.



**Q29. Quick: Greg, Mr. Buffett has a hands-off approach to managing the operating subsidiaries. How would you describe you're approach?**



Abel: My style would be to have questions and comments around their business, their frameworks. They run them autonomously, and that remains in place. We want to make sure the right folks are talking and figuring out how we can benefit from the prior experiences.



Buffett: It's working way better with Greg than with me because I just didn't want to work as hard. Greg can do better at many things. Many people want to be managed, need help in being managed. Some don't. Some you just leave alone. We've had managers it would have been crazy to start giving instructions to because they just quit. And I wouldn't blame them. People want a manager that they admire.



**Q30. Audience: Berkshire Hathaway is the second largest utility provider in the United States, and its coal fleet is the dirtiest in the nation. There is no concrete plan to retire coal and fully transition to renewable energy. What about the consequences of climate change caused by companies like Berkshire?**



Abel: In the early 2000s, we made the decision to build the largest wind project in the US in Iowa. We deployed $16 billion in Iowa associated with renewable energy, consistent with what our state wanted us to do. We have had the opportunity to retire five of the 10 coal units. We've been able to maintain our rates. They're some of the lowest in the country, but the reality is we still need those five coal units to keep the system stable. Our utilities implement policy consistent with the needs of their stakeholders, their customers, and respecting what's required by any of the federal standards.



**Q31. Quick: What ultimately led to the end of your healthcare venture with JP Morgan and Amazon?**



Buffett: We spend close to 20% of GDP on health. People generally like their doctor, didn't like the system. But in the end, JP Morgan and Amazon and Berkshire were not going to have any effect on changing the 20%. Other countries spend 6 or 7% of GDP. The system was too entrenched to really do much in the way of change. Our costs were far higher than Canada, France, or Britain, and to some extent, we were subsidizing the rest of the world. People would come to the United States to do the really unusual or challenging aspects of health in terms of operations. When you have 20% of GDP going into a given industry, it will have political power. We are a very rich country. So we can do things other countries can't do. It's easy to spend money, and it's hard to cut people's receipts. It's so much better to live here than it was 100 years ago or 200 years ago.



**Q32. Audience: You mentioned that Greg will be in charge of capital allocation in the future. Is it easier for a business operator to be an investor or for an investor to be a business operator?**



Buffett: It's a lot tougher to be an operator. It's easier to sit in a room like I do and play around with money. It is an easier life. I've been able to choose my friends. I've never had to work for anybody that I didn't admire. I had 5 different people I worked for, and they were fantastic. I've been able to choose what I do with my day as compared to being a business operator. I can run the kind of company I want to run, and that's an extraordinary luxury.



Buffett: The time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year-end. I would still hang around and could conceivably be useful in a few cases. But the final word would be what Greg said, in operations, in capital deployment, whatever it might be. The board would be more welcome to giving him more authority on large acquisitions probably if they knew I was around. I have no intention, zero, of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway - it will be given away. The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg's management than mine. Thanks for coming. The enthusiasm shown by the audience's response can be interpreted in two ways. But I'll take It as positive. Thank you.



**Meeting Adjourned**



In conclusion, the highlight of the meeting occurred at the end when Warren Buffett announced he was stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on December 31. Greg Abel would then become CEO. Although the timing of this announcement was a surprise, Buffett will be 95 on August 30, and Abel had previously been designated by Buffett to succeed him. Abel has been with Berkshire for over 25 years and has been successfully running all of Berkshire's non-insurance operations since January 2018 as Vice Chairman.



In my opinion, the outlook for Berkshire is very bright, with its most important business, Geico, having been turned around with price matching risk more closely and telematics being successfully introduced.



Berkshire's $20 billion investments in the five Japanese trading companies over the past six years is working out very well. Its over $300 billion in cash should enable Berkshire to take advantage of the next sharp stock market decline and make investments at much lower prices.



Since its May 3 annual meeting, Berkshire's shares have declined by 14%, underperforming the S&P 500 (+12%) by 26 percentage points. This has resulted in Berkshire now trading close to its historical price-to-book value of 1.5, which presents an attractive entry point for investors.

2025-09-02,Warren Buffett says he is ‘disappointed’ in Kraft Heinz split; shares fall 5%,"Warren Buffett told CNBC on Tuesday that he is disappointed in the Kraft Heinz split that unwinds much of the blockbuster merger he masterminded a decade ago.

With a 27.5% stake in the company, Berkshire Hathaway is Kraft Heinz’s largest shareholder. The firm has not touched its shares since the 2015 merger that formed the food conglomerate.

Shares of the company fell more than 3% following Buffett’s comments.

Buffett told CNBC’s Becky Quick on Tuesday that the merger didn’t turn out to be a brilliant idea, but he does not think that taking the company apart will fix its problems.

Greg Abel, who will take reins at Berkshire Hathaway from Buffett at the end of the year, expressed disappointment to Kraft Heinz, according to Buffett.

Kraft Heinz did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Buffett’s stance on the deal.

The split announced earlier on Tuesday once again separates Kraft Heinz into two companies: one focused on sauces, spreads and shelf-stable meals and a second that includes North American staples like Oscar Mayer, Kraft singles and Lunchables.

Berkshire Hathaway teamed up with private equity firm 3G Capital in 2015 to merge Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz. 3G Capital quietly exited its Kraft Heinz investment in 2023, after years of periodically trimming its stake as the company struggled.

Though it holds a roster of iconic brands like Oscar Mayer and Velveeta, Kraft Heinz saw its U.S. sales slip just a few years after the merger. Health-conscious consumers were buying less packaged food and shopping more around the perimeter of the grocery store. Some analysts also blamed the company’s slump on cost-cutting measures that kept Kraft Heinz from investing in its brands at a time when they needed it most.

In an effort to turn around the business, Kraft Heinz sold off some of its portfolio, like Planters nuts and some of its cheese division. The company has also been investing in some of its brands, like Lunchables and Capri Sun. In May, Kraft Heinz executives said that the company was weighing strategic changes and potential transactions.

Even as other investors have lost faith in Kraft Heinz, Buffett has stood by the company.

Regarding Berkshire’s future as a Kraft Heinz investor, Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire will do whatever is in the best interest of the firm. If Berkshire is approached to sell its shares, the firm will not accept a block bid unless other shareholders receive the same offer, according to Buffett.

Though it holds a roster of iconic brands like Oscar Mayer and Velveeta, Kraft Heinz saw its U.S. sales slip just a few years after the merger. Health-conscious consumers were buying less packaged food and shopping more around the perimeter of the grocery store. Some analysts also blamed the company’s slump on cost-cutting measures that kept Kraft Heinz from investing in its brands at a time when they needed it most.

In an effort to turn around the business, Kraft Heinz sold off some of its portfolio, like Planters nuts and some of its cheese division. The company has also been investing in some of its brands, like Lunchables and Capri Sun. In May, Kraft Heinz executives said that the company was weighing strategic changes and potential transactions.

Even as other investors have lost faith in Kraft Heinz, Buffett has stood by the company.

Regarding Berkshire’s future as a Kraft Heinz investor, Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire will do whatever is in the best interest of the firm. If Berkshire is approached to sell its shares, the firm will not accept a block bid unless other shareholders receive the same offer, according to Buffett.

2025-09-15,Trump advocates end to quarterly earnings reports,"President Donald Trump floated the idea Monday of companies no longer providing earnings report on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the idea is “subject to SEC approval” and would “save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.”

“Did you ever hear the statement that, ‘China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!’” Trump said.

The wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.

“In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” the pair wrote.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.

Supporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.

INTRODUCTION

Augmented by the General Re merger, Berkshire's shareholder count has doubled in the past year to about 250,000. Charlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and my partner, and I welcome each of you. As a further greeting, we have prepared a second printing of this booklet to help you understand our business, goals, philosophy and limitations.

These pages are aimed at explaining our broad principles of operation, not at giving you detail about Berkshire's many businesses. For more detail and a continuing update on our progress, you should look to our annual reports. We will be happy to send a copy of our 1997 report to any shareholder requesting it. A great deal of additional information, including our 1977-1996 annual letters, is available at our Internet site: www.berkshirehathaway.com.

OWNER-RELATED BUSINESS PRINCIPLES

At the time of the Blue Chip merger in 1983, I set down 13 owner-related business principles that I thought would help new shareholders understand our managerial approach. As is appropriate for ""principles,"" all 13 remain alive and well today, and they are stated here in italics. A few words have been changed to bring them up-to-date and to each I've added a short commentary.

1. *Although our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership. Charlie Munger and I think of our shareholders as owner-partners, and of ourselves as managing partners. (Because of the size of our shareholdings we are also, for better or worse, controlling partners.) We do not view the company itself as the ultimate owner of our business assets but instead view the company as a conduit through which our shareholders own the assets.*Charlie and I hope that you do not think of yourself as merely owning a piece of paper whose price wiggles around daily and that is a candidate for sale when some economic or political event makes you nervous. We hope you instead visualize yourself as a part owner of a business that you expect to stay with indefinitely, much as you might if you owned a farm or apartment house in partnership with members of your family. For our part, we do not view Berkshire shareholders as faceless members of an ever-shifting crowd, but rather as co-venturers who have entrusted their funds to us for what may well turn out to be the remainder of their lives.The evidence suggests that most Berkshire shareholders have indeed embraced this long-term partnership concept. The annual percentage turnover in Berkshire's shares is a small fraction of that occurring in the stocks of other major American corporations, even when the shares I own are excluded from the [calculation.In](http://calculation.In) effect, our shareholders behave in respect to their Berkshire stock much as Berkshire itself behaves in respect to companies in which it has an investment. As owners of, say, Coca-Cola or Gillette shares, we think of Berkshire as being a non-managing partner in two extraordinary businesses, in which we measure our success by the long-term progress of the companies rather than by the month-to-month movements of their stocks. In fact, we would not care in the least if several years went by in which there was no trading, or quotation of prices, in the stocks of those companies. If we have good long-term expectations, short-term price changes are meaningless for us except to the extent they offer us an opportunity to increase our ownership at an attractive price.
2. *In line with Berkshire's owner-orientation, most of our directors have a major portion of their net worth invested in the company. We eat our own cooking.*Charlie's family has 90% or more of its net worth in Berkshire shares; my wife, Susie, and I have more than 99%. In addition, many of my relatives - my sisters and cousins, for example - keep a huge portion of their net worth in Berkshire stock.Charlie and I feel totally comfortable with this eggs-in-one-basket situation because Berkshire itself owns a wide variety of truly extraordinary businesses. Indeed, we believe that Berkshire is close to being unique in the quality and diversity of the businesses in which it owns either a controlling interest or a minority interest of significance.Charlie and I cannot promise you results. But we can guarantee that your financial fortunes will move in lockstep with ours for whatever period of time you elect to be our partner. We have no interest in large salaries or options or other means of gaining an ""edge"" over you. We want to make money only when our partners do and in exactly the same proportion. Moreover, when I do something dumb, I want you to be able to derive some solace from the fact that my financial suffering is proportional to yours.
3. *Our long-term economic goal (subject to some qualifications mentioned later) is to maximize Berkshire's average annual rate of gain in intrinsic business value on a per-share basis. We do not measure the economic significance or performance of Berkshire by its size; we measure by per-share progress. We are certain that the rate of per-share progress will diminish in the future - a greatly enlarged capital base will see to that. But we will be disappointed if our rate does not exceed that of the average large American corporation.*Since that was written at yearend 1983, our intrinsic value (a topic I'll discuss a bit later) has increased at an annual rate of more than 25%, a pace that has definitely surprised both Charlie and me. Nevertheless the principle just stated remains valid: Operating with large amounts of capital as we do today, we cannot come close to performing as well as we once did with much smaller sums. The best rate of gain in intrinsic value we can even hope for is an average of 15% per annum, and we may well fall far short of that target. Indeed, we think very few large businesses have a chance of compounding intrinsic value at 15% per annum over an extended period of time. So it may be that we will end up meeting our stated goal - being above average - with gains that fall significantly short of 15%.
4. *Our preference would be to reach our goal by directly owning a diversified group of businesses that generate cash and consistently earn above-average returns on capital. Our second choice is to own parts of similar businesses, attained primarily through purchases of marketable common stocks by our insurance subsidiaries. The price and availability of businesses and the need for insurance capital determine any given year's capital allocation.*As has usually been the case, it is easier today to buy small pieces of outstanding businesses via the stock market than to buy similar businesses in their entirety on a negotiated basis. Nevertheless, we continue to prefer the 100% purchase, and in some years we get lucky: In the last three years, in fact, we made seven acquisitions. Though there will be dry years also, we expect to make a number of acquisitions in the decades to come, and our hope is that they will be large. If these purchases approach the quality of those we have made in the past, Berkshire will be well served.The challenge for us is to generate ideas as rapidly as we generate cash. In this respect, a depressed stock market is likely to present us with significant advantages. For one thing, it tends to reduce the prices at which entire companies become available for purchase. Second, a depressed market makes it easier for our insurance companies to buy small pieces of wonderful businesses - including additional pieces of businesses we already own - at attractive prices. And third, some of those same wonderful businesses, such as Coca-Cola, are consistent buyers of their own shares, which means that they, and we, gain from the cheaper prices at which they can buy.Overall, Berkshire and its long-term shareholders benefit from a sinking stock market much as a regular purchaser of food benefits from declining food prices. So when the market plummets - as it will from time to time - neither panic nor mourn. It's good news for Berkshire.
5. *Because of our two-pronged approach to business ownership and because of the limitations of conventional accounting, consolidated reported earnings may reveal relatively little about our true economic performance. Charlie and I, both as owners and managers, virtually ignore such consolidated numbers. However, we will also report to you the earnings of each major business we control, numbers we consider of great importance. These figures, along with other information we will supply about the individual businesses, should generally aid you in making judgments about them.*To state things simply, we try to give you in the annual report the numbers and other information that really matter. Charlie and I pay a great deal of attention to how well our businesses are doing, and we also work to understand the environment in which each business is operating. For example, is one of our businesses enjoying an industry tailwind or is it facing a headwind? Charlie and I need to know exactly which situation prevails and to adjust our expectations accordingly. We will also pass along our conclusions to you.Over time, practically all of our businesses have exceeded our expectations. But occasionally we have disappointments, and we will try to be as candid in informing you about those as we are in describing the happier experiences. When we use unconventional measures to chart our progress - for instance, you will be reading in our annual reports about insurance ""float"" - we will try to explain these concepts and why we regard them as important. In other words, we believe in telling you how we think so that you can evaluate not only Berkshire's businesses but also assess our approach to management and capital allocation.
6. *Accounting consequences do not influence our operating or capital-allocation decisions. When acquisition costs are similar, we much prefer to purchase $2 of earnings that is not reportable by us under standard accounting principles than to purchase $1 of earnings that is reportable. This is precisely the choice that often faces us since entire businesses (whose earnings will be fully reportable) frequently sell for double the pro-rata price of small portions (whose earnings will be largely unreportable). In aggregate and over time, we expect the unreported earnings to be fully reflected in our intrinsic business value through capital gains.*We attempt to offset the shortcomings of conventional accounting by regularly reporting ""look-through"" earnings (though, for special and nonrecurring reasons, we occasionally omit them). The look-through numbers include Berkshire's own reported operating earnings, excluding capital gains and purchase-accounting adjustments (an explanation of which occurs later in this message) plus Berkshire's share of the undistributed earnings of our major investees - amounts that are not included in Berkshire's figures under conventional accounting. From these undistributed earnings of our investees we subtract the tax we would have owed had the earnings been paid to us as dividends. We also exclude capital gains, purchase-accounting adjustments and extraordinary charges or credits from the investee numbers.We have found over time that the undistributed earnings of our investees, in aggregate, have been fully as beneficial to Berkshire as if they had been distributed to us (and therefore had been included in the earnings we officially report). This pleasant result has occurred because most of our investees are engaged in truly outstanding businesses that can often employ incremental capital to great advantage, either by putting it to work in their businesses or by repurchasing their shares. Obviously, every capital decision that our investees have made has not benefitted us as shareholders, but overall we have garnered far more than a dollar of value for each dollar they have retained. We consequently regard look-through earnings as realistically portraying our yearly gain from [operations.In](http://operations.In) 1992, our look-through earnings were $604 million, and in that same year we set a goal of raising them by an average of 15% per annum to $1.8 billion in the year 2000. Since that time, however, we have issued additional shares - including a significant number in the 1998 merger with General Re - so that we now need look-through earnings of $2.4 billion in 2000 to match the per-share goal we originally were shooting for. This is a target we still hope to hit.
7. *We use debt sparingly and, when we do borrow, we attempt to structure our loans on a long-term fixed-rate basis. We will reject interesting opportunities rather than over-leverage our balance sheet. This conservatism has penalized our results but it is the only behavior that leaves us comfortable, considering our fiduciary obligations to policyholders, lenders and the many equity holders who have committed unusually large portions of their net worth to our care. (As one of the Indianapolis ""500"" winners said: ""To finish first, you must first finish."")*The financial calculus that Charlie and I employ would never permit our trading a good night's sleep for a shot at a few extra percentage points of return. I've never believed in risking what my family and friends have and need in order to pursue what they don't have and don't need.Besides, Berkshire has access to two low-cost, non-perilous sources of leverage that allow us to safely own far more assets than our equity capital alone would permit: deferred taxes and ""float,"" the funds of others that our insurance business holds because it receives premiums before needing to pay out losses. Both of these funding sources have grown rapidly and now total about $32 billion.Better yet, this funding to date has been cost-free. Deferred tax liabilities bear no interest. And as long as we can break even in our insurance underwriting - which we have done, on the average, during our 32 years in the business - the cost of the float developed from that operation is zero. Neither item, of course, is equity; these are real liabilities. But they are liabilities without covenants or due dates attached to them. In effect, they give us the benefit of debt - an ability to have more assets working for us - but saddle us with none of its drawbacks.Of course, there is no guarantee that we can obtain our float in the future at no cost. But we feel our chances of attaining that goal are as good as those of anyone in the insurance business. Not only have we reached the goal in the past (despite a number of important mistakes by your Chairman), our 1996 acquisition of GEICO materially improved our prospects for getting there in the future.
8. *A managerial ""wish list"" will not be filled at shareholder expense. We will not diversify by purchasing entire businesses at control prices that ignore long-term economic consequences to our shareholders. We will only do with your money what we would do with our own, weighing fully the values you can obtain by diversifying your own portfolios through direct purchases in the stock market.*Charlie and I are interested only in acquisitions that we believe will raise the per-share intrinsic value of Berkshire's stock. The size of our paychecks or our offices will never be related to the size of Berkshire's balance sheet.
9. *We feel noble intentions should be checked periodically against results. We test the wisdom of retaining earnings by assessing whether retention, over time, delivers shareholders at least $1 of market value for each $1 retained. To date, this test has been met. We will continue to apply it on a five-year rolling basis. As our net worth grows, it is more difficult to use retained earnings wisely.*We continue to pass the test, but the challenges of doing so have grown more difficult. If we reach the point that we can't create extra value by retaining earnings, we will pay them out and let our shareholders deploy the funds.
10. *We will issue common stock only when we receive as much in business value as we give. This rule applies to all forms of issuance - not only mergers or public stock offerings, but stock- for-debt swaps, stock options, and convertible securities as well. We will not sell small portions of your company - and that is what the issuance of shares amounts to - on a basis inconsistent with the value of the entire enterprise.*When we sold the Class B shares in 1996, we stated that Berkshire stock was not undervalued - and some people found that shocking. That reaction was not well-founded. Shock should have registered instead had we issued shares when our stock was undervalued. Managements that say or imply during a public offering that their stock is undervalued are usually being economical with the truth or uneconomical with their existing shareholders' money: Owners unfairly lose if their managers deliberately sell assets for 80› that in fact are worth $1. We didn't commit that kind of crime in our offering of Class B shares and we never will. (We did *not*, however, say at the time of the sale that our stock was overvalued, though many media have reported that we did.)
11. *You should be fully aware of one attitude Charlie and I share that hurts our financial performance: Regardless of price, we have no interest at all in selling any good businesses that Berkshire owns. We are also very reluctant to sell sub-par businesses as long as we expect them to generate at least some cash and as long as we feel good about their managers and labor relations. We hope not to repeat the capital-allocation mistakes that led us into such sub- par businesses. And we react with great caution to suggestions that our poor businesses can be restored to satisfactory profitability by major capital expenditures. (The projections will be dazzling and the advocates sincere, but, in the end, major additional investment in a terrible industry usually is about as rewarding as struggling in quicksand.) Nevertheless, gin rummy managerial behavior (discard your least promising business at each turn) is not our style. We would rather have our overall results penalized a bit than engage in that kind of behavior.*We continue to avoid gin rummy behavior. True, we closed our textile business in the mid-1980's after 20 years of struggling with it, but only because we felt it was doomed to run never-ending operating losses. We have not, however, given thought to selling operations that would command very fancy prices nor have we dumped our laggards, though we focus hard on curing the problems that cause them to lag.
12. *We will be candid in our reporting to you, emphasizing the pluses and minuses important in appraising business value. Our guideline is to tell you the business facts that we would want to know if our positions were reversed. We owe you no less. Moreover, as a company with a major communications business, it would be inexcusable for us to apply lesser standards of accuracy, balance and incisiveness when reporting on ourselves than we would expect our news people to apply when reporting on others. We also believe candor benefits us as managers: The CEO who misleads others in public may eventually mislead himself in private.*At Berkshire you will find no ""big bath"" accounting maneuvers or restructurings nor any ""smoothing"" of quarterly or annual results. We will always tell you how many strokes we have taken on each hole and never play around with the scorecard. When the numbers are a very rough ""guesstimate,"" as they necessarily must be in insurance reserving, we will try to be both consistent and conservative in our approach.We will be communicating with you in several ways. Through the annual report, I try to give all shareholders as much value- defining information as can be conveyed in a document kept to reasonable length. We also try to convey a liberal quantity of condensed but important information in our quarterly reports, though I don't write those (one recital a year is enough). Still another important occasion for communication is our Annual Meeting, at which Charlie and I are delighted to spend five hours or more answering questions about Berkshire. But there is one way we can't communicate: on a one-on-one basis. That isn't feasible given Berkshire's many thousands of [owners.In](http://owners.In) all of our communications, we try to make sure that no single shareholder gets an edge: We do not follow the usual practice of giving earnings ""guidance"" or other information of value to analysts or large shareholders. Our goal is to have all of our owners updated at the same time.
13. *Despite our policy of candor, we will discuss our activities in marketable securities only to the extent legally required. Good investment ideas are rare, valuable and subject to competitive appropriation just as good product or business acquisition ideas are. Therefore we normally will not talk about our investment ideas. This ban extends even to securities we have sold (because we may purchase them again) and to stocks we are incorrectly rumored to be buying. If we deny those reports but say ""no comment"" on other occasions, the no-comments become confirmation.*Though we continue to be unwilling to talk about specific stocks, we freely discuss our business and investment philosophy. I benefitted enormously from the intellectual generosity of Ben Graham, the greatest teacher in the history of finance, and I believe it appropriate to pass along what I learned from him, even if that creates new and able investment competitors for Berkshire just as Ben's teachings did for him.

AN ADDED PRINCIPLE

To the extent possible, we would like each Berkshire shareholder to record a gain or loss in market value during his period of ownership that is proportional to the gain or loss in per-share intrinsic value recorded by the company during that holding period. For this to come about, the relationship between the intrinsic value and the market price of a Berkshire share would need to remain constant, and by our preferences at 1-to-1. As that implies, we would rather see Berkshire's stock price at a fair level than a high level. Obviously, Charlie and I can't control Berkshire's price. But by our policies and communications, we can encourage informed, rational behavior by owners that, in turn, will tend to produce a stock price that is also rational. Our it's-as-bad-to-be- overvalued-as-to-be-undervalued approach may disappoint some shareholders. We believe, however, that it affords Berkshire the best prospect of attracting long-term investors who seek to profit from the progress of the company rather than from the investment mistakes of their partners.

INTRINSIC VALUE

Now let's focus on two terms that I mentioned earlier and that you will encounter in future annual reports.

Let's start with intrinsic value, an all-important concept that offers the only logical approach to evaluating the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses. Intrinsic value can be defined simply: It is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life.

The calculation of intrinsic value, though, is not so simple. As our definition suggests, intrinsic value is an estimate rather than a precise figure, and it is additionally an estimate that must be changed if interest rates move or forecasts of future cash flows are revised. Two people looking at the same set of facts, moreover - and this would apply even to Charlie and me - will almost inevitably come up with at least slightly different intrinsic value figures. That is one reason we never give you our estimates of intrinsic value. What our annual reports do supply, though, are the facts that we ourselves use to calculate this value.

Meanwhile, we regularly report our per-share book value, an easily calculable number, though one of limited use. The limitations do not arise from our holdings of marketable securities, which are carried on our books at their current prices. Rather the inadequacies of book value have to do with the companies we control, whose values as stated on our books may be far different from their intrinsic values.

The disparity can go in either direction. For example, in 1964 we could state with certitude that Berkshire's per-share book value was $19.46. However, that figure considerably overstated the company's intrinsic value, since all of the company's resources were tied up in a sub-profitable textile business. Our textile assets had neither going- concern nor liquidation values equal to their carrying values. Today, however, Berkshire's situation is reversed: Now, our book value *far* understates Berkshire's intrinsic value, a point true because many of the businesses we control are worth much more than their carrying value.

Inadequate though they are in telling the story, we give you Berkshire's book-value figures because they today serve as a rough, albeit significantly understated, tracking measure for Berkshire's intrinsic value. In other words, the percentage change in book value in any given year is likely to be reasonably close to that year's change in intrinsic value.

You can gain some insight into the differences between book value and intrinsic value by looking at one form of investment, a college education. Think of the education's cost as its ""book value."" If this cost is to be accurate, it should include the earnings that were foregone by the student because he chose college rather than a job.

For this exercise, we will ignore the important non-economic benefits of an education and focus strictly on its economic value. First, we must estimate the earnings that the graduate will receive over his lifetime and subtract from that figure an estimate of what he would have earned had he lacked his education. That gives us an excess earnings figure, which must then be discounted, at an appropriate interest rate, back to graduation day. The dollar result equals the intrinsic economic value of the education.

Some graduates will find that the book value of their education exceeds its intrinsic value, which means that whoever paid for the education didn't get his money's worth. In other cases, the intrinsic value of an education will far exceed its book value, a result that proves capital was wisely deployed. In all cases, what is clear is that book value is meaningless as an indicator of intrinsic value.

PURCHASE-ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS

Next: spinach time. I know that a discussion of accounting technicalities turns off many readers, so let me assure you that a full and happy life can still be yours if you decide to skip this section.

Our 1996 acquisition of GEICO, however, means that purchase-accounting adjustments of about $40 million are charged against our annual earnings as recorded under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our General Re acquisition will produce an annual charge many times this number, but we don't have final figures at this time. The magnitude of these changes makes them a subject of importance to Berkshire. In our annual reports, therefore, we will sometimes talk of earnings that we will describe as ""before purchase-accounting adjustments."" The discussion that follows will tell you why we think earnings of that description have far more economic meaning than the earnings produced by GAAP.

When Berkshire buys a business for a premium over the GAAP net worth of the acquiree - as will usually be the case, since most companies we'd want to buy don't come at a discount - that premium has to be entered on the asset side of our balance sheet. There are loads of rules about just how a company should record the premium. But to simplify this discussion, we will focus on ""Goodwill,"" the asset item to which almost all of Berkshire's acquisition premiums have been allocated. For example, when we acquired in 1996 the half of GEICO we didn't previously own, we recorded goodwill of about $1.6 billion.

GAAP requires goodwill to be amortized - that is, written off - over a period no longer than 40 years. Therefore, to extinguish our $1.6 billion in GEICO goodwill, we will take annual charges of about $40 million until 2036. This amount is not deductible for tax purposes, so it reduces both our pre-tax and after-tax earnings by $40 million.

In an accounting sense, consequently, our GEICO goodwill will disappear gradually in even-sized bites. But the one thing I can guarantee you is that the economic goodwill we have purchased at GEICO will not decline in the same measured way. In fact, my best guess is that the economic goodwill assignable to GEICO has dramatically increased since our purchase and will likely continue to increase - quite probably in a very substantial way.

I made a similar statement in our 1983 Annual Report about the goodwill attributed to See's Candy, when I used that company as an example in a discussion of goodwill accounting. At that time, our balance sheet carried about $36 million of See's goodwill. We have since been charging about $1 million against earnings every year in order to amortize the asset, and the See's goodwill on our balance sheet is now down to about $21 million. In other words, from an accounting standpoint, See's is now presented as having lost a good deal of goodwill since 1983.

The economic facts could not be more different. In 1983, See's earned about $27 million pre-tax on $11 million of net operating assets; in 1997 it earned $59 million on $5 million of net operating assets. Clearly See's economic goodwill has increased dramatically during the interval rather than decreased. Just as clearly, See's is worth many hundreds of millions of dollars more than its stated value on our books.

We could, of course, be wrong, but we expect that GEICO's gradual loss of accounting value will contunue to be paired with major increases in its economic value. Certainly that has been the pattern at most of our subsidiaries, not just See's. That is why we regularly present our operating earnings in a way that allows you to ignore all purchase-accounting adjustments.

Before leaving this subject, we should issue an important warning: Investors are often led astray by CEOs and Wall Street analysts who equate depreciation charges with the amortization charges we have just discussed. In no way are the two the same: With rare exceptions, depreciation is an economic cost every bit as real as wages, materials, or taxes. Certainly that is true at Berkshire and at virtually all the other businesses we have studied. Furthermore, we do not think so-called EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a meaningful measure of performance. Managements that dismiss the importance of depreciation - and emphasize ""cash flow"" or EBITDA - are apt to make faulty decisions, and you should keep that in mind as you make your own investment decisions.

THE MANAGING OF BERKSHIRE

I think it's appropriate that I conclude with a discussion of Berkshire's management, today and in the future. As our first owner- related principle tells you, Charlie and I are the managing partners of Berkshire. But we subcontract all of the heavy lifting in this business to the managers of our subsidiaries. In fact, we delegate almost to the point of abdication: Though Berkshire has about 45,000 employees, only 12 of these are at headquarters.

Charlie and I mainly attend to capital allocation and the care and feeding of our key managers. Most of these managers are happiest when they are left alone to run their businesses, and that is customarily just how we leave them. That puts them in charge of all operating decisions and of dispatching the excess cash they generate to headquarters. By sending it to us, they don't get diverted by the various enticements that would come their way were they responsible for deploying the cash their businesses throw off. Furthermore, Charlie and I are exposed to a much wider range of possibilities for investing these funds than any of our managers could find in his or her own industry.

Most of our managers are independently wealthy, and it's therefore up to us to create a climate that encourages them to choose working with Berkshire over golfing or fishing. This leaves us needing to treat them fairly and in the manner that we would wish to be treated if our positions were reversed.

As for the allocation of capital, that's an activity both Charlie and I enjoy and in which we have acquired some useful experience. In a general sense, grey hair doesn't hurt on this playing field: You don't need good hand-eye coordination or well-toned muscles to push money around (thank heavens). As long as our minds continue to function effectively, Charlie and I can keep on doing our jobs pretty much as we have in the past.

On my death, Berkshire's ownership picture will change but not in a disruptive way: First, only about 1% of my stock will have to be sold to take care of bequests and taxes; second, the balance of my stock will go to my wife, Susan, if she survives me, or to a family foundation if she doesn't. In either event, Berkshire will possess a controlling shareholder guided by the same philosophy and objectives that now set our course.

At that juncture, the Buffett family will not be involved in managing the business, only in picking and overseeing the managers who do. Just who those managers will be, of course, depends on the date of my death. But I can anticipate what the management structure will be: Essentially my job will be split into two parts, with one executive becoming responsible for investments and another for operations. If the acquisition of new businesses is in prospect, the two will cooperate in making the decisions needed. Both executives will report to a board of directors who will be responsive to the controlling shareholder, whose interests will in turn be aligned with yours.

Were we to need the management structure I have just described on an immediate basis, my family and a few key individuals know who I would pick to fill both posts. Both currently work for Berkshire and are people in whom I have total confidence.

I will continue to keep my family posted on the succession issue. Since Berkshire stock will make up virtually my entire estate and will account for a similar portion of the assets of either my wife or the foundation for a considerable period after my death, you can be sure that I have thought through the succession question carefully. You can be equally sure that the principles we have employed to date in running Berkshire will continue to guide the managers who succeed me.

Lest we end on a morbid note, I also want to assure you that I have never felt better. I love running Berkshire, and if enjoying life promotes longevity, Methuselah's record is in jeopardy.

2025-09-21,"Berkshire Hathaway Inc., An Owner's Manual","Based on the posts and comments I see here, I think a lot of you would benefit from reading and contemplating the ""owner's manual"" that Buffett and Munger produced and subsequently updated back in 1999.  Although dated, it seems an accurate reflection of how Berkshire has been managed over the years and during the time I've owned the stock.  I think if you are interested in owning shares of Berkshire for any period of time, you should probably understand how Buffett and Munger think about the company and its shareholders.  The principles from 1983 and 1999 haven't changed much over the intervening years.

Interestingly, under current circumstances, Principle #9 is worthy of discussion.  Not sure I've heard much from Buffett about that particular test in a while.

INTRODUCTION

Augmented by the General Re merger, Berkshire's shareholder count has doubled in the past year to about 250,000. Charlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and my partner, and I welcome each of you. As a further greeting, we have prepared a second printing of this booklet to help you understand our business, goals, philosophy and limitations.

These pages are aimed at explaining our broad principles of operation, not at giving you detail about Berkshire's many businesses. For more detail and a continuing update on our progress, you should look to our annual reports. We will be happy to send a copy of our 1997 report to any shareholder requesting it. A great deal of additional information, including our 1977-1996 annual letters, is available at our Internet site: www.berkshirehathaway.com.

OWNER-RELATED BUSINESS PRINCIPLES

At the time of the Blue Chip merger in 1983, I set down 13 owner-related business principles that I thought would help new shareholders understand our managerial approach. As is appropriate for ""principles,"" all 13 remain alive and well today, and they are stated here in italics. A few words have been changed to bring them up-to-date and to each I've added a short commentary.

1. *Although our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership. Charlie Munger and I think of our shareholders as owner-partners, and of ourselves as managing partners. (Because of the size of our shareholdings we are also, for better or worse, controlling partners.) We do not view the company itself as the ultimate owner of our business assets but instead view the company as a conduit through which our shareholders own the assets.*Charlie and I hope that you do not think of yourself as merely owning a piece of paper whose price wiggles around daily and that is a candidate for sale when some economic or political event makes you nervous. We hope you instead visualize yourself as a part owner of a business that you expect to stay with indefinitely, much as you might if you owned a farm or apartment house in partnership with members of your family. For our part, we do not view Berkshire shareholders as faceless members of an ever-shifting crowd, but rather as co-venturers who have entrusted their funds to us for what may well turn out to be the remainder of their lives.The evidence suggests that most Berkshire shareholders have indeed embraced this long-term partnership concept. The annual percentage turnover in Berkshire's shares is a small fraction of that occurring in the stocks of other major American corporations, even when the shares I own are excluded from the [calculation.In](http://calculation.In) effect, our shareholders behave in respect to their Berkshire stock much as Berkshire itself behaves in respect to companies in which it has an investment. As owners of, say, Coca-Cola or Gillette shares, we think of Berkshire as being a non-managing partner in two extraordinary businesses, in which we measure our success by the long-term progress of the companies rather than by the month-to-month movements of their stocks. In fact, we would not care in the least if several years went by in which there was no trading, or quotation of prices, in the stocks of those companies. If we have good long-term expectations, short-term price changes are meaningless for us except to the extent they offer us an opportunity to increase our ownership at an attractive price.
2. *In line with Berkshire's owner-orientation, most of our directors have a major portion of their net worth invested in the company. We eat our own cooking.*Charlie's family has 90% or more of its net worth in Berkshire shares; my wife, Susie, and I have more than 99%. In addition, many of my relatives - my sisters and cousins, for example - keep a huge portion of their net worth in Berkshire stock.Charlie and I feel totally comfortable with this eggs-in-one-basket situation because Berkshire itself owns a wide variety of truly extraordinary businesses. Indeed, we believe that Berkshire is close to being unique in the quality and diversity of the businesses in which it owns either a controlling interest or a minority interest of significance.Charlie and I cannot promise you results. But we can guarantee that your financial fortunes will move in lockstep with ours for whatever period of time you elect to be our partner. We have no interest in large salaries or options or other means of gaining an ""edge"" over you. We want to make money only when our partners do and in exactly the same proportion. Moreover, when I do something dumb, I want you to be able to derive some solace from the fact that my financial suffering is proportional to yours.
3. *Our long-term economic goal (subject to some qualifications mentioned later) is to maximize Berkshire's average annual rate of gain in intrinsic business value on a per-share basis. We do not measure the economic significance or performance of Berkshire by its size; we measure by per-share progress. We are certain that the rate of per-share progress will diminish in the future - a greatly enlarged capital base will see to that. But we will be disappointed if our rate does not exceed that of the average large American corporation.*Since that was written at yearend 1983, our intrinsic value (a topic I'll discuss a bit later) has increased at an annual rate of more than 25%, a pace that has definitely surprised both Charlie and me. Nevertheless the principle just stated remains valid: Operating with large amounts of capital as we do today, we cannot come close to performing as well as we once did with much smaller sums. The best rate of gain in intrinsic value we can even hope for is an average of 15% per annum, and we may well fall far short of that target. Indeed, we think very few large businesses have a chance of compounding intrinsic value at 15% per annum over an extended period of time. So it may be that we will end up meeting our stated goal - being above average - with gains that fall significantly short of 15%.
4. *Our preference would be to reach our goal by directly owning a diversified group of businesses that generate cash and consistently earn above-average returns on capital. Our second choice is to own parts of similar businesses, attained primarily through purchases of marketable common stocks by our insurance subsidiaries. The price and availability of businesses and the need for insurance capital determine any given year's capital allocation.*As has usually been the case, it is easier today to buy small pieces of outstanding businesses via the stock market than to buy similar businesses in their entirety on a negotiated basis. Nevertheless, we continue to prefer the 100% purchase, and in some years we get lucky: In the last three years, in fact, we made seven acquisitions. Though there will be dry years also, we expect to make a number of acquisitions in the decades to come, and our hope is that they will be large. If these purchases approach the quality of those we have made in the past, Berkshire will be well served.The challenge for us is to generate ideas as rapidly as we generate cash. In this respect, a depressed stock market is likely to present us with significant advantages. For one thing, it tends to reduce the prices at which entire companies become available for purchase. Second, a depressed market makes it easier for our insurance companies to buy small pieces of wonderful businesses - including additional pieces of businesses we already own - at attractive prices. And third, some of those same wonderful businesses, such as Coca-Cola, are consistent buyers of their own shares, which means that they, and we, gain from the cheaper prices at which they can buy.Overall, Berkshire and its long-term shareholders benefit from a sinking stock market much as a regular purchaser of food benefits from declining food prices. So when the market plummets - as it will from time to time - neither panic nor mourn. It's good news for Berkshire.
5. *Because of our two-pronged approach to business ownership and because of the limitations of conventional accounting, consolidated reported earnings may reveal relatively little about our true economic performance. Charlie and I, both as owners and managers, virtually ignore such consolidated numbers. However, we will also report to you the earnings of each major business we control, numbers we consider of great importance. These figures, along with other information we will supply about the individual businesses, should generally aid you in making judgments about them.*To state things simply, we try to give you in the annual report the numbers and other information that really matter. Charlie and I pay a great deal of attention to how well our businesses are doing, and we also work to understand the environment in which each business is operating. For example, is one of our businesses enjoying an industry tailwind or is it facing a headwind? Charlie and I need to know exactly which situation prevails and to adjust our expectations accordingly. We will also pass along our conclusions to you.Over time, practically all of our businesses have exceeded our expectations. But occasionally we have disappointments, and we will try to be as candid in informing you about those as we are in describing the happier experiences. When we use unconventional measures to chart our progress - for instance, you will be reading in our annual reports about insurance ""float"" - we will try to explain these concepts and why we regard them as important. In other words, we believe in telling you how we think so that you can evaluate not only Berkshire's businesses but also assess our approach to management and capital allocation.
6. *Accounting consequences do not influence our operating or capital-allocation decisions. When acquisition costs are similar, we much prefer to purchase $2 of earnings that is not reportable by us under standard accounting principles than to purchase $1 of earnings that is reportable. This is precisely the choice that often faces us since entire businesses (whose earnings will be fully reportable) frequently sell for double the pro-rata price of small portions (whose earnings will be largely unreportable). In aggregate and over time, we expect the unreported earnings to be fully reflected in our intrinsic business value through capital gains.*We attempt to offset the shortcomings of conventional accounting by regularly reporting ""look-through"" earnings (though, for special and nonrecurring reasons, we occasionally omit them). The look-through numbers include Berkshire's own reported operating earnings, excluding capital gains and purchase-accounting adjustments (an explanation of which occurs later in this message) plus Berkshire's share of the undistributed earnings of our major investees - amounts that are not included in Berkshire's figures under conventional accounting. From these undistributed earnings of our investees we subtract the tax we would have owed had the earnings been paid to us as dividends. We also exclude capital gains, purchase-accounting adjustments and extraordinary charges or credits from the investee numbers.We have found over time that the undistributed earnings of our investees, in aggregate, have been fully as beneficial to Berkshire as if they had been distributed to us (and therefore had been included in the earnings we officially report). This pleasant result has occurred because most of our investees are engaged in truly outstanding businesses that can often employ incremental capital to great advantage, either by putting it to work in their businesses or by repurchasing their shares. Obviously, every capital decision that our investees have made has not benefitted us as shareholders, but overall we have garnered far more than a dollar of value for each dollar they have retained. We consequently regard look-through earnings as realistically portraying our yearly gain from [operations.In](http://operations.In) 1992, our look-through earnings were $604 million, and in that same year we set a goal of raising them by an average of 15% per annum to $1.8 billion in the year 2000. Since that time, however, we have issued additional shares - including a significant number in the 1998 merger with General Re - so that we now need look-through earnings of $2.4 billion in 2000 to match the per-share goal we originally were shooting for. This is a target we still hope to hit.
7. *We use debt sparingly and, when we do borrow, we attempt to structure our loans on a long-term fixed-rate basis. We will reject interesting opportunities rather than over-leverage our balance sheet. This conservatism has penalized our results but it is the only behavior that leaves us comfortable, considering our fiduciary obligations to policyholders, lenders and the many equity holders who have committed unusually large portions of their net worth to our care. (As one of the Indianapolis ""500"" winners said: ""To finish first, you must first finish."")*The financial calculus that Charlie and I employ would never permit our trading a good night's sleep for a shot at a few extra percentage points of return. I've never believed in risking what my family and friends have and need in order to pursue what they don't have and don't need.Besides, Berkshire has access to two low-cost, non-perilous sources of leverage that allow us to safely own far more assets than our equity capital alone would permit: deferred taxes and ""float,"" the funds of others that our insurance business holds because it receives premiums before needing to pay out losses. Both of these funding sources have grown rapidly and now total about $32 billion.Better yet, this funding to date has been cost-free. Deferred tax liabilities bear no interest. And as long as we can break even in our insurance underwriting - which we have done, on the average, during our 32 years in the business - the cost of the float developed from that operation is zero. Neither item, of course, is equity; these are real liabilities. But they are liabilities without covenants or due dates attached to them. In effect, they give us the benefit of debt - an ability to have more assets working for us - but saddle us with none of its drawbacks.Of course, there is no guarantee that we can obtain our float in the future at no cost. But we feel our chances of attaining that goal are as good as those of anyone in the insurance business. Not only have we reached the goal in the past (despite a number of important mistakes by your Chairman), our 1996 acquisition of GEICO materially improved our prospects for getting there in the future.
8. *A managerial ""wish list"" will not be filled at shareholder expense. We will not diversify by purchasing entire businesses at control prices that ignore long-term economic consequences to our shareholders. We will only do with your money what we would do with our own, weighing fully the values you can obtain by diversifying your own portfolios through direct purchases in the stock market.*Charlie and I are interested only in acquisitions that we believe will raise the per-share intrinsic value of Berkshire's stock. The size of our paychecks or our offices will never be related to the size of Berkshire's balance sheet.
9. *We feel noble intentions should be checked periodically against results. We test the wisdom of retaining earnings by assessing whether retention, over time, delivers shareholders at least $1 of market value for each $1 retained. To date, this test has been met. We will continue to apply it on a five-year rolling basis. As our net worth grows, it is more difficult to use retained earnings wisely.*We continue to pass the test, but the challenges of doing so have grown more difficult. If we reach the point that we can't create extra value by retaining earnings, we will pay them out and let our shareholders deploy the funds.
10. *We will issue common stock only when we receive as much in business value as we give. This rule applies to all forms of issuance - not only mergers or public stock offerings, but stock- for-debt swaps, stock options, and convertible securities as well. We will not sell small portions of your company - and that is what the issuance of shares amounts to - on a basis inconsistent with the value of the entire enterprise.*When we sold the Class B shares in 1996, we stated that Berkshire stock was not undervalued - and some people found that shocking. That reaction was not well-founded. Shock should have registered instead had we issued shares when our stock was undervalued. Managements that say or imply during a public offering that their stock is undervalued are usually being economical with the truth or uneconomical with their existing shareholders' money: Owners unfairly lose if their managers deliberately sell assets for 80› that in fact are worth $1. We didn't commit that kind of crime in our offering of Class B shares and we never will. (We did *not*, however, say at the time of the sale that our stock was overvalued, though many media have reported that we did.)
11. *You should be fully aware of one attitude Charlie and I share that hurts our financial performance: Regardless of price, we have no interest at all in selling any good businesses that Berkshire owns. We are also very reluctant to sell sub-par businesses as long as we expect them to generate at least some cash and as long as we feel good about their managers and labor relations. We hope not to repeat the capital-allocation mistakes that led us into such sub- par businesses. And we react with great caution to suggestions that our poor businesses can be restored to satisfactory profitability by major capital expenditures. (The projections will be dazzling and the advocates sincere, but, in the end, major additional investment in a terrible industry usually is about as rewarding as struggling in quicksand.) Nevertheless, gin rummy managerial behavior (discard your least promising business at each turn) is not our style. We would rather have our overall results penalized a bit than engage in that kind of behavior.*We continue to avoid gin rummy behavior. True, we closed our textile business in the mid-1980's after 20 years of struggling with it, but only because we felt it was doomed to run never-ending operating losses. We have not, however, given thought to selling operations that would command very fancy prices nor have we dumped our laggards, though we focus hard on curing the problems that cause them to lag.
12. *We will be candid in our reporting to you, emphasizing the pluses and minuses important in appraising business value. Our guideline is to tell you the business facts that we would want to know if our positions were reversed. We owe you no less. Moreover, as a company with a major communications business, it would be inexcusable for us to apply lesser standards of accuracy, balance and incisiveness when reporting on ourselves than we would expect our news people to apply when reporting on others. We also believe candor benefits us as managers: The CEO who misleads others in public may eventually mislead himself in private.*At Berkshire you will find no ""big bath"" accounting maneuvers or restructurings nor any ""smoothing"" of quarterly or annual results. We will always tell you how many strokes we have taken on each hole and never play around with the scorecard. When the numbers are a very rough ""guesstimate,"" as they necessarily must be in insurance reserving, we will try to be both consistent and conservative in our approach.We will be communicating with you in several ways. Through the annual report, I try to give all shareholders as much value- defining information as can be conveyed in a document kept to reasonable length. We also try to convey a liberal quantity of condensed but important information in our quarterly reports, though I don't write those (one recital a year is enough). Still another important occasion for communication is our Annual Meeting, at which Charlie and I are delighted to spend five hours or more answering questions about Berkshire. But there is one way we can't communicate: on a one-on-one basis. That isn't feasible given Berkshire's many thousands of [owners.In](http://owners.In) all of our communications, we try to make sure that no single shareholder gets an edge: We do not follow the usual practice of giving earnings ""guidance"" or other information of value to analysts or large shareholders. Our goal is to have all of our owners updated at the same time.
13. *Despite our policy of candor, we will discuss our activities in marketable securities only to the extent legally required. Good investment ideas are rare, valuable and subject to competitive appropriation just as good product or business acquisition ideas are. Therefore we normally will not talk about our investment ideas. This ban extends even to securities we have sold (because we may purchase them again) and to stocks we are incorrectly rumored to be buying. If we deny those reports but say ""no comment"" on other occasions, the no-comments become confirmation.*Though we continue to be unwilling to talk about specific stocks, we freely discuss our business and investment philosophy. I benefitted enormously from the intellectual generosity of Ben Graham, the greatest teacher in the history of finance, and I believe it appropriate to pass along what I learned from him, even if that creates new and able investment competitors for Berkshire just as Ben's teachings did for him.

AN ADDED PRINCIPLE

To the extent possible, we would like each Berkshire shareholder to record a gain or loss in market value during his period of ownership that is proportional to the gain or loss in per-share intrinsic value recorded by the company during that holding period. For this to come about, the relationship between the intrinsic value and the market price of a Berkshire share would need to remain constant, and by our preferences at 1-to-1. As that implies, we would rather see Berkshire's stock price at a fair level than a high level. Obviously, Charlie and I can't control Berkshire's price. But by our policies and communications, we can encourage informed, rational behavior by owners that, in turn, will tend to produce a stock price that is also rational. Our it's-as-bad-to-be- overvalued-as-to-be-undervalued approach may disappoint some shareholders. We believe, however, that it affords Berkshire the best prospect of attracting long-term investors who seek to profit from the progress of the company rather than from the investment mistakes of their partners.

INTRINSIC VALUE

Now let's focus on two terms that I mentioned earlier and that you will encounter in future annual reports.

Let's start with intrinsic value, an all-important concept that offers the only logical approach to evaluating the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses. Intrinsic value can be defined simply: It is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life.

The calculation of intrinsic value, though, is not so simple. As our definition suggests, intrinsic value is an estimate rather than a precise figure, and it is additionally an estimate that must be changed if interest rates move or forecasts of future cash flows are revised. Two people looking at the same set of facts, moreover - and this would apply even to Charlie and me - will almost inevitably come up with at least slightly different intrinsic value figures. That is one reason we never give you our estimates of intrinsic value. What our annual reports do supply, though, are the facts that we ourselves use to calculate this value.

Meanwhile, we regularly report our per-share book value, an easily calculable number, though one of limited use. The limitations do not arise from our holdings of marketable securities, which are carried on our books at their current prices. Rather the inadequacies of book value have to do with the companies we control, whose values as stated on our books may be far different from their intrinsic values.

The disparity can go in either direction. For example, in 1964 we could state with certitude that Berkshire's per-share book value was $19.46. However, that figure considerably overstated the company's intrinsic value, since all of the company's resources were tied up in a sub-profitable textile business. Our textile assets had neither going- concern nor liquidation values equal to their carrying values. Today, however, Berkshire's situation is reversed: Now, our book value *far* understates Berkshire's intrinsic value, a point true because many of the businesses we control are worth much more than their carrying value.

Inadequate though they are in telling the story, we give you Berkshire's book-value figures because they today serve as a rough, albeit significantly understated, tracking measure for Berkshire's intrinsic value. In other words, the percentage change in book value in any given year is likely to be reasonably close to that year's change in intrinsic value.

You can gain some insight into the differences between book value and intrinsic value by looking at one form of investment, a college education. Think of the education's cost as its ""book value."" If this cost is to be accurate, it should include the earnings that were foregone by the student because he chose college rather than a job.

For this exercise, we will ignore the important non-economic benefits of an education and focus strictly on its economic value. First, we must estimate the earnings that the graduate will receive over his lifetime and subtract from that figure an estimate of what he would have earned had he lacked his education. That gives us an excess earnings figure, which must then be discounted, at an appropriate interest rate, back to graduation day. The dollar result equals the intrinsic economic value of the education.

Some graduates will find that the book value of their education exceeds its intrinsic value, which means that whoever paid for the education didn't get his money's worth. In other cases, the intrinsic value of an education will far exceed its book value, a result that proves capital was wisely deployed. In all cases, what is clear is that book value is meaningless as an indicator of intrinsic value.

PURCHASE-ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS

Next: spinach time. I know that a discussion of accounting technicalities turns off many readers, so let me assure you that a full and happy life can still be yours if you decide to skip this section.

Our 1996 acquisition of GEICO, however, means that purchase-accounting adjustments of about $40 million are charged against our annual earnings as recorded under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our General Re acquisition will produce an annual charge many times this number, but we don't have final figures at this time. The magnitude of these changes makes them a subject of importance to Berkshire. In our annual reports, therefore, we will sometimes talk of earnings that we will describe as ""before purchase-accounting adjustments."" The discussion that follows will tell you why we think earnings of that description have far more economic meaning than the earnings produced by GAAP.

When Berkshire buys a business for a premium over the GAAP net worth of the acquiree - as will usually be the case, since most companies we'd want to buy don't come at a discount - that premium has to be entered on the asset side of our balance sheet. There are loads of rules about just how a company should record the premium. But to simplify this discussion, we will focus on ""Goodwill,"" the asset item to which almost all of Berkshire's acquisition premiums have been allocated. For example, when we acquired in 1996 the half of GEICO we didn't previously own, we recorded goodwill of about $1.6 billion.

GAAP requires goodwill to be amortized - that is, written off - over a period no longer than 40 years. Therefore, to extinguish our $1.6 billion in GEICO goodwill, we will take annual charges of about $40 million until 2036. This amount is not deductible for tax purposes, so it reduces both our pre-tax and after-tax earnings by $40 million.

In an accounting sense, consequently, our GEICO goodwill will disappear gradually in even-sized bites. But the one thing I can guarantee you is that the economic goodwill we have purchased at GEICO will not decline in the same measured way. In fact, my best guess is that the economic goodwill assignable to GEICO has dramatically increased since our purchase and will likely continue to increase - quite probably in a very substantial way.

I made a similar statement in our 1983 Annual Report about the goodwill attributed to See's Candy, when I used that company as an example in a discussion of goodwill accounting. At that time, our balance sheet carried about $36 million of See's goodwill. We have since been charging about $1 million against earnings every year in order to amortize the asset, and the See's goodwill on our balance sheet is now down to about $21 million. In other words, from an accounting standpoint, See's is now presented as having lost a good deal of goodwill since 1983.

The economic facts could not be more different. In 1983, See's earned about $27 million pre-tax on $11 million of net operating assets; in 1997 it earned $59 million on $5 million of net operating assets. Clearly See's economic goodwill has increased dramatically during the interval rather than decreased. Just as clearly, See's is worth many hundreds of millions of dollars more than its stated value on our books.

We could, of course, be wrong, but we expect that GEICO's gradual loss of accounting value will contunue to be paired with major increases in its economic value. Certainly that has been the pattern at most of our subsidiaries, not just See's. That is why we regularly present our operating earnings in a way that allows you to ignore all purchase-accounting adjustments.

Before leaving this subject, we should issue an important warning: Investors are often led astray by CEOs and Wall Street analysts who equate depreciation charges with the amortization charges we have just discussed. In no way are the two the same: With rare exceptions, depreciation is an economic cost every bit as real as wages, materials, or taxes. Certainly that is true at Berkshire and at virtually all the other businesses we have studied. Furthermore, we do not think so-called EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a meaningful measure of performance. Managements that dismiss the importance of depreciation - and emphasize ""cash flow"" or EBITDA - are apt to make faulty decisions, and you should keep that in mind as you make your own investment decisions.

THE MANAGING OF BERKSHIRE

I think it's appropriate that I conclude with a discussion of Berkshire's management, today and in the future. As our first owner- related principle tells you, Charlie and I are the managing partners of Berkshire. But we subcontract all of the heavy lifting in this business to the managers of our subsidiaries. In fact, we delegate almost to the point of abdication: Though Berkshire has about 45,000 employees, only 12 of these are at headquarters.

Charlie and I mainly attend to capital allocation and the care and feeding of our key managers. Most of these managers are happiest when they are left alone to run their businesses, and that is customarily just how we leave them. That puts them in charge of all operating decisions and of dispatching the excess cash they generate to headquarters. By sending it to us, they don't get diverted by the various enticements that would come their way were they responsible for deploying the cash their businesses throw off. Furthermore, Charlie and I are exposed to a much wider range of possibilities for investing these funds than any of our managers could find in his or her own industry.

Most of our managers are independently wealthy, and it's therefore up to us to create a climate that encourages them to choose working with Berkshire over golfing or fishing. This leaves us needing to treat them fairly and in the manner that we would wish to be treated if our positions were reversed.

As for the allocation of capital, that's an activity both Charlie and I enjoy and in which we have acquired some useful experience. In a general sense, grey hair doesn't hurt on this playing field: You don't need good hand-eye coordination or well-toned muscles to push money around (thank heavens). As long as our minds continue to function effectively, Charlie and I can keep on doing our jobs pretty much as we have in the past.

On my death, Berkshire's ownership picture will change but not in a disruptive way: First, only about 1% of my stock will have to be sold to take care of bequests and taxes; second, the balance of my stock will go to my wife, Susan, if she survives me, or to a family foundation if she doesn't. In either event, Berkshire will possess a controlling shareholder guided by the same philosophy and objectives that now set our course.

At that juncture, the Buffett family will not be involved in managing the business, only in picking and overseeing the managers who do. Just who those managers will be, of course, depends on the date of my death. But I can anticipate what the management structure will be: Essentially my job will be split into two parts, with one executive becoming responsible for investments and another for operations. If the acquisition of new businesses is in prospect, the two will cooperate in making the decisions needed. Both executives will report to a board of directors who will be responsive to the controlling shareholder, whose interests will in turn be aligned with yours.

Were we to need the management structure I have just described on an immediate basis, my family and a few key individuals know who I would pick to fill both posts. Both currently work for Berkshire and are people in whom I have total confidence.

I will continue to keep my family posted on the succession issue. Since Berkshire stock will make up virtually my entire estate and will account for a similar portion of the assets of either my wife or the foundation for a considerable period after my death, you can be sure that I have thought through the succession question carefully. You can be equally sure that the principles we have employed to date in running Berkshire will continue to guide the managers who succeed me.

Lest we end on a morbid note, I also want to assure you that I have never felt better. I love running Berkshire, and if enjoying life promotes longevity, Methuselah's record is in jeopardy.

2025-09-22,Why did Berkshire Hathaway finally sell out of BYD after 17 years?,"Berkshire Hathaway has fully exited its BYD stake, ending an investment that began in 2008 with a $230M purchase of a 10% holding and grew more than 20-fold in value. The move comes as BYD posts its first profit decline in over three years and lowers its annual sales target by up to 16% to 4.6M vehicles. 

Domestic sales, which make up nearly 80% of its total, have now fallen for four straight months, while Beijing’s pressure on EV price wars squeezes margins. Once valued at $415M at the end of 2024, Berkshire’s stake was marked at zero by March 2025, closing a 17-year chapter that BYD publicly thanked as “help and companionship.”",121,60

2025-09-23,Markets And Gold Are Both Hitting ATHs. Last Time That Happened Was...,"COVID, which as a rare global event driven by a pandemic. Then, before that, in 2007. Right before it hit the fan in 2008 with the financial crisis.

Historically, gold and the markets have been divergent. When people are optimistic, they pile into the markets. When they get worried, they move into gold. It's pretty rare to see them both hitting ATHs at the same time. I am curious to hear your thoughts on this.

From my perspective, it seems all of society is bifurcated right now on just about everything. We have a large group of Chicken Little's, that think this is all going to blow up in our faces any day now. Even Warren/Berkshire is holding a record amount of cash and more T-Bills that the Treasury itself ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/why-warren-buffett-s-berkshire-hathaway-now-owns-more-treasury-bills-than-the-federal-reserve-11807572)). Conversely, we seem to have an equal size group of Pollyanna's that think we are entering into some sort of golden age and manage to find a silver lining in every bit of news (pun intended). I am somewhat agnostic and think both groups are not seeing things too clearly. At the end of the day, it is the optimistic crowd that drives the markets and set the prices. If they keep thinking they are getting a good deal and remain willing buy what the others are selling, and they believe in it enough to hold, then the markets will just keep going up or possibly plateau for a while until some external event drives them in either direction.

There is lots of money going into specific buckets right now, such as AI and crypto, which is also hitting ATHs. I have no idea what people think they will do with the stupid amount of money flowing into crypto and its offshoot financial products (other than trying to make a quick buck). And I think all the AI plays will take much longer to shake out and find the winners and losers than most people think (like the dot-com era). I view AI stocks with mind numbing P/Es, precious metals, and crypto as all something investors would need a high level of conviction and a buy-and-hold mindset to buy into right now at these levels. And I question how much conviction is really there.

With both groups (Chicken Little's and Pollyanna's) buying into both sides of fear and optimism, it seems like every scenario is priced in. It's like a double bubble face-off that just keeps growing, just waiting for something to happen. Even if more geopolitical turmoil erupts and/or inflation starts ticking back up with high unemployment, are people really going to buy in more to precious metals when they are at ATHs already? Without hitting the bottom line in spectacular fashion, is there any development that can get AI more hyped and inflated while we wait for it to generate a real ROI somewhere? And what if nothing happens at all and things more-or-less stay the same economically and geopolitically?",994,337

Bill Gates Buys 6.95M Berkshire Hathaway Class B Shares, Offloads 2.26M Microsoft Shares in Q2
Story by Niloy Chakrabarti  • 

In Q2, billionaire investor Bill Gates executed major stock trades worth over $4 billion (£2.9 billion) in two companies.

According to the latest filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Bill Gates purchased 6.95 million shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class B (NYSE: BKR.B) shares for the quarter ended 30th June, increasing his stake in Warren Buffett's company by a whopping 40.48%. The shares would be worth $3.43 billion (£2.54 billion) based on the closing price of $494.10 (£366.1) on Tuesday. He now owns 24.1 million Berkshire Class B shares worth over $11 billion (£8.1 billion).

Gates' decision comes after offloading millions of BRK.B shares in the previous four consecutive quarters.

In Q2, Gates Foundation Trust also offloaded 2.26 million shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), as Gates trimmed his stake in the company he founded by 7.96%. The stock sale would be worth $1.15 billion (£852 million) based on Tuesday's closing price of $509.23 (£377.3). Gates still owns 26.1 million Microsoft shares worth over $13 billion (£9.6 billion).

Gates has sold over 8.7 million shares of Microsoft since Q2 2024 despite the stock price surging over 17% in the past one year. According to analysts polled by TipRanks, Microsoft has a 12-month stock price target of $625.78 (£463.6) with the highest forecast of $680 (£503.8) from Citi.

According to a late-June filing with the SEC, legendary investor Buffett converted 8,239 Class A shares of Berkshire Hathaway into 12.35 million Class B shares of the common stock, where each Class A share was convertible into 1,500 Class B shares. He then donated over 9.4 million of those converted class B shares to the Gates Foundation Trust. The filing noted that these donations are in accordance with the Oracle of Omaha's lifetime commitments.

Buffett also donated 943,384 of the converted shares to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after his late first wife, and 660,366 shares to each of the Sherwood Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, and the NoVo Foundation, which are run by his three children.

In 2006, Buffett had pledged to donate 85% of his Berkshire Hathaway stake to charity, most of which was supposed to go to Gates' foundation. However, he revealed in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last year that the donations to the Gates Foundation would stop after he passes away.

Although the legendary investor did not divulge many details behind the decision, he had earlier said while resigning from the Gates Foundation board that his goals are 100% in sync with those of the foundation, and that his 'physical participation is in no way needed to achieve these goals.'

The Berkshire Hathaway Class B and Microsoft stocks make up 51.8% of Gates' $47 billion (£34.8 billion) portfolio, which comprises 25 stocks. The next stock in his portfolio with the highest exposure is Waste Management (NYSE: WM), accounting for 15.4% of his portfolio. He owns 32.3 million shares of the company worth over $7.3 billion (£5.4 billion).

Waste Management is followed by Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI), Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT), and Deere & Co (NYSE: DE), with stakes worth $5.7 billion (£4.2 billion), $2.8 billion (£2 billion), and $1.8 billion (£1.3 billion), respectively.",83,33
