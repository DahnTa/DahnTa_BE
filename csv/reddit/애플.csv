2024-11-01,Apple Shoots for the Stars: Expanded Globalstar Deal Signals Big Moves in Satellite Tech,"Apple’s latest move in satellite services could be a game-changer, following an expanded partnership with Globalstar that sent Globalstar's stock surging by 64%. This update builds on their existing arrangement, now aimed at expanding the scope and scale of satellite services for Apple users. This strategic collaboration taps into Globalstar's satellite capabilities, potentially positioning Apple as a stronger player in emergency communication services and beyond. As demand grows for reliable, on-the-go connectivity, especially in remote areas, Apple’s foray into satellite tech signals its ongoing push to integrate groundbreaking communication tech directly into its products.

2024-11-02,Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold ~$14 billion worth of Apple this quarter. Cash pile hits record ~$325 billion.,"Berkshires cash on hand hits a record $325 Billion

Currently owns ~$69.9 Billion worth of Apple $AAPL as of the end of Q3 down from $84.2B worth as of the end of Q2

No brk.a or brk.b shares repurchase in Q3

Posts Q3 revenue of $92.9B compared to $93.2B YoY

Operating earnings fell 6% from a year earlier to $10.09 billion as insurance underwriting earnings slumped

#

>**It is being widely reported that Berkshire's operating earnings declined 6.2% in the quarter. No. The reported figures include unrealized currency losses in 2024 and gains in 2023 on BRK's debt denominated in foreign currencies, largely yen. Earnings really grew 8.5% in Q3 to $11.2 billion against $10.3 billion and were up 18.0% for the nine months to $33.0 billion from $28.0 billion. Just as short-term movements in equity prices can distort the reporting of operating profits, so to do currency swings on debt outstanding. Both should be excluded from an analysis of operating and economic profit.**

2024-11-03,Globalstar and Apple expanded partnership ,"Does anyone have anymore information on Globalstar GSAT and Apple AAPL expanded partnership? Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.

Here is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? 

The expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  
Potential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  industries (e.g. maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple.
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  
2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.
In the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.

Also, I feel Elon has had a tiff with Apple in the past with them pulling ads from Twitter/X, Elon trying to launch Tesla Phone and some history with Apple refusing to buy Tesla since Elon had put some shitty condition like he wants to be CEO of Apple as part of the deal.

2024-12-04,"Apple's stock price hits a new high, recapturing the number one spot in market cap. Is a new 'super product cycle' on the horizon?","**As 2025 approaches, the countdown is on for the release of a number of new Apple products. According to reports, Apple will bring a series of anticipated new products in the spring of 2025, covering a number of popular product lines such as the iPhone SE, iPad and MacBook Air. Are investors ready for a new “super cycle”?**

  
**Monday, $ Apple (AAPL.US)$ closed up 0.95%, shares rose to $ 239.59, hitting a new record high, the total market capitalization exceeded 3.62 trillion U.S. dollars, regaining the first global market value throne, compared with the second place of the NVIDIA has been higher than 250 billion U.S. dollars.

It is worth noting that since April this year, Apple's share price ushered in a sustained rise, has risen more than 45% over the closing low point on April 19 this year. The strong performance of Apple's stock price not only reflects the company's growth momentum, but also shows investors' confidence in its future development. What are the driving factors behind this upward trend?

  
Outstanding earnings performance. In the fourth fiscal quarter, when the new generation of iPhones just hit the market, the revenue of Apple's core product, iPhone, returned to positive growth, and the growth momentum exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driving the company's total revenue to a record high for the same period. The solid financial situation undoubtedly provides investors with confidence.

Technology innovation and AI strategic layout. While the core products are changing, Apple is also launching new products, from Apple Watch to smart home products, to meet the diversified needs of consumers. In addition, Apple's continued expansion in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence has laid the foundation for its future growth with the gradual release of Apple's AI capabilities.

Global market expansion. Apple's sales revenue in Europe, Japan and other Asia-Pacific regions outside of China and Japan all accelerated in the fourth fiscal quarter, such as India, Southeast Asia and Africa, which have low smartphone penetration rates and huge market potential, are also growing rapidly. At the same time, Apple is also promoting the relocation of the industrial chain, especially to emerging markets such as India, with a view to further reducing costs, expanding production capacity and developing new market growth points.

According to my analysis of Apple’s recent stock performance, I think the stock is going to go down in the next 10 days. The Bollinger Band is widening, which means the market is extremely volatile, price has broken above the top Band and that stock may be over bought. Further, the price is also much higher than the 20 day Exponential Moving Average (EMA 20), which usually precedes a mean reversion or a price correction. The MACD line is clearly above the signal line indicating strong bullish momentum, however, this huge separation can be the precursor to a reversal as other indicators show overextension. Along with a low number of trades being conducted, the price surge does not support these recent levels, implying a lack of strong buying interest pushing the price to the levels it is now. This collection of technical indicators tells us collectively that in the not too distant future the stock performance of Apple may see a pullback or correction.

2024-12-12,How come AAPL isn’t affected by the rise of the AI market?,"One might wonder how AAPL has managed to remain largely unaffected by the rapid rise of AI technology. Unlike the competitors, Apple doesn’t seem to be actively showing as of today any developed LLM yet, just announcements. Meanwhile,  besides OpenAI, Google every other day is improvindg their Gemini, Microsoft has firmly planted its foot in the door with its heavy involvement in OpenAI. Third parties like Meta and Elon Musk have already into the LLM market as competitors. All in all, most released systems are already at the 2nd or 3rd generation, at least. Yet, nothing of the sort appears to be happening within Apple. Despite this, AAPL hasn’t suffered any major setbacks; in fact, it has been steadily growing in recent years. What’s keeping Apple from losing ground? What’s your take on this?",57,70

I kinda got this idea in my head that AAPL is a company without much growth left and have been thinking about lightening up my position on it.

So I decided to make some graphs to figure out what to think and because pictures easy raw data hard. 

First off I was curious what apple's shares outstanding looked like. I know their buy back program is massive and I also know they're not growing top line revenue but are spending a ton on buybacks so this was a good place to start. Considering the share price has also been going up a lot and their market cap is massive so I thought buybacks might have a negligible effect. Wow was I wrong. The shares outstanding are down like 36% in ten years! I couldn't ask for a better looking chart. At this rate it'll all be bought back in like 18.9 more years.

Then I was obviously curious about the EPS and decided to graph that. I was less surprised about how this turned out but it did still offer some insights. I hadn't seen before that they had multiple recent periods of EPS decline that they managed to turn around in big ways. And their EPS since covid is surprisingly down less than I thought so that's not so bad.

It doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative on a level that would spur a ton of growth, who tf needs another slimmer iPhone, iPad etc and I think that's a pretty widely held belief given the charts.

However, it's pretty crazy to see that they've bought back a 3rd of their shares in the past 9 years. Also pretty wild to see how its EPS has grown despite not a lot of innovation.

Lastly I was curious how their wearables revenue was doing because I heard recently about the FDA approving AirPods to be hearing devices which is probably a huge market? IDK but what I do know is hearing aids are stupid expensive compared to $200 air pods so this could be big. So far it looks like wearables is doing about $9B a quarter so if growth in that picked up it could be meaningful

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

>\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024).

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024).

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024).

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

2025-01-24,Anyone else trim their AAPL position?,"Basically the title. AAPL had an amazing run but has run into serious headwind these past weeks and now the downgrades from analysts. 

I’ve never been one to buy into the AI hype but Apple’s implementation simply can’t work with their commitment to privacy. From a tech perspective, I believe the looser the restrictions in the name of privacy, the better the results. Which is why Siri has always sucked. 

There’s only so much you can do with on-device models. Developing a pattern based on your data will help. It also helps advertisers. Again, in my opinion why Google is better at AI. 

AAPL will have to just fall back on hardware and unless they unveil a folding iPhone next year, I have a bad feeling about their stock price.",15,64

Apple, as hedge fund managers are well aware, is one stock that always bounces back



It’s hard not to be cynical about Wall Street when you see a chart like the one at right, which traces Apple’s (AAPL) share price over the past four weeks.

It not terribly surprising that the stock has shot up nearly 20% in the past two weeks to close at an all-time high Friday of $422. The iPhone 4S is selling briskly and the company is expected to report record earnings on Tuesday.

I’m reminded in times like these of Jason Schwarz’s Apple: Seven Reasons Shorts Love It, first published in 2009. The meat of it can be boiled down to two sentences:

“If you can keep a good stock down then you are able to load up for the ride back up. It’s like a slingshot — the harder you pull, the more propulsion you generate.”

Apple is the market leader. This one stock has become so important to the market that its action is contagious. This influence makes Apple a prized possession for both the longs and the shorts.

2025-01-29,Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones,"**Thoughts:** Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business (but may be bad/neutral for sat comm companies that do not work with AAPL such as GSAT), TMUS, and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. 

>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company’s in-house satellite-communication service.

>

>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone’s latest software update — released Monday — now supports the technology.

>

>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.

>

>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.

>

>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, “You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.” Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.

>

>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will “begin with select optimized smartphones” and that the full launch will “support the vast majority of modern smartphones.” T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

>

>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there’s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple’s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has “had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.”

>

>Here’s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.

>

>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.

>

>There’s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically — even when the phone is in a customer’s pocket.

>

>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don’t have cellular service. The capabilities can’t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.

>

>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple’s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn’t disclose the Starlink support.

>

>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile’s cellular network in November.

Sales are down, VR had been a flop, AI wasn’t released with the 16, iOS 18 news mishap, and most importantly, they’ve lost serious market share in mainland China.

The latter is the main driving force, with possible tariffs on the horizon, minimal innovation, and minimal growth anticipated, I could see apple retracing back to its

2025-01-31,"Apple misses on iPhone revenue, sees 11% drop in China sales","Apple’s overall revenue rose by 4% in the first quarter, but it missed on Wall Street’s iPhone sales expectations and saw sales in China decline 11.1%, the company reported on Thursday. 

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending Dec. 28. 

Earnings per share: $2.40 vs. $2.35 estimated 

Revenue: $124.30 billion vs. $124.12 billion estimated 

 iPhone revenue: $69.14 billion vs. $71.03 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $8.99 billion vs. $7.96 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $8.09 billion vs. $7.32 billion estimated 

Other Products revenue: $11.75 billion vs. $12.01 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $26.34 billion vs. $26.09 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.9% vs. 46.5% estimated 

 Although Apple’s overall sales rose during the quarter, the company’s closely watched iPhone sales actually declined slightly on a year-over-year basis. The December quarter is the first full quarter with iPhone 16 sales, and Apple released its Apple Intelligence AI suite for the devices during the quarter.  

Apple’s iPhone miss versus LSEG estimates was the biggest for the company in two years, since its first-quarter earnings report in fiscal 2023. At the time, Apple said that its miss was because it was unable to make enough iPhone 14 models because of production issues in China. 

The company saw significant weakness in Greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Overall China sales declined 11.1% during the quarter to $18.51 billion. It’s the largest drop in China sales since the same quarter last year when they fell 12.9%. 

Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that iPhone sales were stronger in countries where Apple Intelligence is available. Currently, the software is only available in a handful of English-speaking countries, and it isn’t accessible in China or in Chinese. 

“During the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple intelligence,” Cook said.  

Cook told CNBC that there were three factors in the company’s China performance. He said that half of the 11.1% decline was due to a change in “channel inventory,” the fact that Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in the region and that after the quarter ended, China issued a national subsidy that would stimulate some Apple product sales.  

“If you look at the negative 11, half of the decline is due to a change in channel inventory, and so the operational performance is better,” Cook said. 

Apple executives usually give some color about how the current quarter is shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is expecting guidance for the March quarter of $1.66 in earnings per share on $95.46 billion in revenue. 

The company reported $36.33 billion in net income during the quarter, up 7.1% from $33.92 billion in the same period last year. 

Apple’s iPad and Mac sales showed strong growth over last year’s struggling sales in the holiday quarter. Mac revenue rose 15% to $8.98 billion and iPad revenue grew 15% to $8.08 billion. 

The company released new Macs during the quarter, including new iMac, Mac Mini and MacBook Pro laptops in October, partially contributing to the growth. Apple also launched a new iPad Mini during the quarter. Cook attributed the growth to the new products.  

“It’s driven by the significant excitement around our latest Mac lineup,” Cook said.  

Apple’s profit engine, its Services division, which includes subscriptions, warranties and licensing deals, reported $23.12 billion in revenue, which is 14% higher than the same period last year. Cook said that the company had over 1 billion subscriptions, which includes both direct subscriptions for services like Apple TV+ and iCloud, as well as subscriptions to third-party apps through the company’s App Store system.  

The company’s “other products” category, also called Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats and Vision Pro sales, declined 2% on a year-over-year basis to $11.75 billion in sales. 

Apple said it would pay a dividend of 25 cents per share and spent $30 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter.

2025-02-01,"After strong earnings, Morgan Stanley inches up AAPL target to $275",,475,35
2025-02-01,"AAPL - 26,527.62% return over 25 years","Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares.  I bought 1200 dollars worth.

In early 2000, I had just graduated college.  I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker.

 I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase.

 Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My  college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs.  I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people’s reactions to Jobs.  He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X.  

These were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power.  And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit.  I hadn’t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. 

I sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple.  `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. 

And…. it  came tumbling down in April 2000.  Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months.  When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back.

Every year, I would consider would I buy more apple now?  And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it.

Every time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits.

•	2-for-1 split in 2000  
•	2-for-1 split in 2005  
•	7-for-1 split in 2014  
•	4-for-1 split in 2020

Nowadays cost basis: .88 cents.     As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today.

The security that owning these securities has offered me is significant.  It has let me have a job that isn’t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them.

I do think it’s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children.  Although I didn’t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition.  

I do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is “Don’t buy crap if you can help it”, and that's my advice to new investors.",988,139

2025-02-13,"Apple Interested In Making Humanoid Robot, Top Analyst Says","Source: Investor Business Daily reporting on Twitter post.

A top Apple (AAPL) stock analyst says the consumer electronics giant is mulling whether to make a humanoid robot.

In a post on social network X on Wednesday, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple is exploring both humanoid and nonhumanoid robots as part of its future smart-home ecosystem.

""These products are still in the early proof-of-concept (POC) stage internally,"" Kuo said. ""Given current progress and typical development cycles, Apple's robot mass production likely won't start until 2028 or later.""

""Interestingly, Apple has been unusually open about sharing some of its robotics research during the early POC stage — possibly to attract talent,"" he added.

Kuo cautioned that Apple is still very early in the product development cycle. The proof-of-concept stage is a ""testing ground"" used to determine whether core technologies and product ideas are viable before proceeding.

Apple's rumored foldable iPhone is also in the proof-of-concept stage, he said.

2025-02-15,Did Apple over promise and under deliver on Apple Intelligence?,"It seems like last year they hyped it up so much, half of it, if not all is “still in the works” and the only things we’ve seen tangible are:

- Genmoji
- Playground
- Notification Summaries
- ChatGPT in Siri (which has so many issues)

Most of which are completely useless and add no real value.

When is the real core fundamental shift coming, I.e a new Siri 2.0. Something that actually creates value? And a need to have access to it and upgrade your handset.

If this was their plan to sell handsets than I’m not surprised it’s not doing as well as planned. Here in Australia they are advertising Genmoji on a billboard. Seeing this I couldn’t be more embarrassed as an AAPL shareholder.",14,21
2025-02-16,Original Research: When Does Apple Become a Buy? Or “How Makeup  Really Can Make You the Prettiest Girl in the Room”,"Apple is the world’s most valuable company, the most beloved consumer brand, and the best-run capital return machine in the modern stock market. It has survived every bear thesis, adapted to every challenge, and delivered shareholders a relentless stream of buybacks, dividends, and steady earnings growth.

At 33x forward earnings, the market is pricing Apple as if it will continue this dominance indefinitely. But no company can defy gravity forever. Apple’s next phase of growth depends on emerging markets, where its traditional advantages—brand strength, pricing power, and ecosystem lock-in—are not guaranteed to work the same way they have in the U.S. and Europe.

Much like a perfectly applied face of makeup, Apple looks flawless at first glance. But take a closer look, and a few cracks start to appear. Buybacks are masking slowing earnings growth. Services margins, long assumed to be unassailable, are under regulatory threat. And in markets where Apple is banking on its next wave of users, it’s facing competition from companies that know these regions better and are playing an entirely different game.

The market assumes Apple will extend its dominance effortlessly. The data suggests otherwise.

# The Market Assumes the iPhone Will Conquer Everywhere. That’s a Risky Bet.

In North America, Apple’s pricing power is sacred. In emerging markets, it is anything but.

Apple’s dominance in the U.S. is built on two things: a premium brand and a seamless ecosystem. People don’t leave iOS because switching out of iMessage, AirDrop, and the App Store is a hassle. But in places like India, Latin America, and Africa, the default phone isn’t an iPhone. It’s an Android device, often made by Xiaomi, OPPO, or Transsion, where users have already built their own ecosystems of digital services.

That’s a problem for Apple’s long-term growth. If users in these markets don’t start on iOS, they aren’t going to be locked into Apple’s ecosystem later. And in the places where Apple is growing, it’s often doing so by selling older iPhones at discounted prices—an approach that works for market share but erodes the premium pricing model that has sustained its margins.

Apple is winning some battles, but at what cost?

* **Latin America**: iPhone shipments jumped 21% year-over-year in 2024, but most of that growth came from discounted older models and local assembly in Brazil to avoid import tariffs. The broader smartphone market in the region grew 10% in the same period. That means Apple isn’t necessarily taking over—it’s just keeping up by cutting prices. Meanwhile, Xiaomi continues to outsell Apple, offering comparable hardware at a fraction of the price.
* **India**: Apple is making its biggest push yet, opening flagship stores in Mumbai and Delhi, ramping up local manufacturing, and introducing aggressive financing options. Morgan Stanley estimates India will account for 15% of Apple’s revenue growth over the next five years. But the market reality is stark: iOS has less than 11% market share, and the vast majority of smartphones sold in India cost under $300. Apple has already had to cut iPhone 15 prices shortly after launch due to weak demand. If Apple is forced to compete on price in India, it risks undermining its premium brand without capturing users who will spend heavily on services later.
* **Africa**: Apple has barely made a dent. iOS accounts for just 13% of smartphone OS usage on the continent, where Transsion dominates by offering localized software, low prices, and an understanding of informal distribution channels that Apple simply doesn’t have. There is no clear path for Apple to break into the mass market in Africa without fundamentally changing its business model.
* **China**: The country that once seemed like Apple’s second home is becoming more difficult. Huawei’s resurgence in 2024 cut into Apple’s iPhone sales, forcing Apple to offer rare price cuts on iPhones and Macs. That’s a red flag—Apple has built its entire business on not needing to lower prices to stimulate demand.

The big takeaway is that Apple’s expansion into emerging markets is not coming from a position of strength. The company is selling more phones, but only by making pricing concessions. The North American investor base, still anchored to the idea that Apple can charge whatever it wants, may not be fully appreciating what this means for long-term margins.

# Apple’s Valuation Assumes Its Services Model Works Everywhere. That’s Not a Given.

Apple is no longer just a hardware company—at least, that’s the argument bulls have made for the past five years. With nearly $90 billion in annual revenue, Apple’s Services business is treated as the company’s long-term growth engine, the high-margin hedge against slowing hardware sales.

But Services growth depends on Apple’s ability to monetize its installed base at the same high rates it does in the U.S. and Europe. That assumption is now running into regulatory roadblocks.

* The EU’s Digital Markets Act (2024-2025) will force Apple to allow third-party app stores and alternative payment systems.
* India, South Korea, and Japan are introducing similar measures.
* The DOJ and FTC in the U.S. are escalating scrutiny on Apple’s App Store model.

The App Store has historically operated with 70-80% operating margins, making it one of the most profitable businesses in the world. But if Apple is forced to cut its 30% commission on in-app purchases or allow competing app stores on iOS, that margin could start to shrink.

Investors have priced Apple as if its Services business will continue expanding indefinitely. But they may be underestimating how much of that growth has been built on monopolistic practices that regulators are now actively dismantling.

# Margins Are Peaking, and Buybacks Are Holding Up the Stock—For Now.

Apple’s gross margin hit a record 47% in 2024, thanks to a greater mix of Services revenue and cost efficiencies in hardware production. But the factors that have driven margin expansion over the past decade are starting to reverse.

* Price sensitivity in emerging markets means Apple may have to sell lower-cost iPhones, reducing hardware margins.
* Regulatory risks to the App Store mean Services margins could compress.
* China’s slowing demand threatens Apple’s most profitable international market.

Meanwhile, Apple’s capital return strategy is doing much of the heavy lifting for its stock price. The company generates over $90 billion in free cash flow annually and spends nearly all of it on buybacks, helping to sustain EPS growth even as revenue growth slows. Without buybacks, Apple’s true earnings trajectory would look much less impressive.

# When Does Apple Become a Buy?

Apple is a great business, but at 33x forward earnings, it should be too rich for most investors. I believe it can become a great business at a great price through one of mechanisms:

* Multiple compression below 20x earnings.
* A regulatory overreaction that temporarily depresses the stock beyond actual impact.
* A broad macro selloff that ignores Apple’s cash-generating ability.

Apple is priced as if its growth story will continue uninterrupted. But in emerging markets, competition is tougher, and pricing power is weaker. The Services business, which has carried Apple’s margins, is now facing existential regulatory threats. Buybacks are keeping the stock afloat, but they can only do so much. Apple will still be a great business in five years. But is it a great stock at today’s price? I don't think it is.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I’m new to equity analysis and have put together the above deep dive on Apple’s valuation, particularly its challenges in emerging markets and risks to services growth. Please let me know what you think about Apple's share price and future.

I work on these memos for my own personal investments. I hold Apple indirectly through VGT.

**TLDR:** My analysis indicates Apple is a weaker equity than people might think —Apple’s future growth relies on price-sensitive markets where it lacks its usual pricing power, while services, its high-margin growth driver, faces regulatory threats. Without a new major revenue stream, growth looks constrained. Management has a strong track record of launching successful businesses, but at 33x forward earnings believing they’ll pull something new out of the hat requires a leap of faith.",0,46

NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the ""short straws in life.""

Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.

The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.

He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly shown his ability"" to deploy capital.

""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.

Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.

Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.

Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.

Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.

""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.

'FISCAL FOLLY'

This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.

""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.

Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.

He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by ""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.

He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""

Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on people's ability to participate.

That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.

""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.
""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,"" he added.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.

Other stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.

Berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.
The company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.

Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.

""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.

Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.

Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""

The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.
In discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.

""We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,"" he said. ""In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.""

NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the ""short straws in life.""

Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.

The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.

He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly shown his ability"" to deploy capital.

""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.

Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.

Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.

Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.

Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.

""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.

'FISCAL FOLLY'

This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.

""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.

Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.

He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by ""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.

He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""

Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on people's ability to participate.

That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.

""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.
""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,"" he added.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.

Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.

The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.

He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly shown his ability"" to deploy capital.

""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.

Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.

Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.

Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.

Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.

""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.

'FISCAL FOLLY'

This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.

""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.

Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.

He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by ""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.

He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""

Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on people's ability to participate.

That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.

""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.
""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,"" he added.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.

Other stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.

Berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.
The company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.

Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.

""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.

Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.

Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""

The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.
In discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.

""We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,"" he said. ""In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.""

He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by ""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.

He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""

Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on people's ability to participate.

That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.

""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.
""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,"" he added.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.

Other stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.

Berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.
The company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.

Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.

""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.

Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.

Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""

The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.
In discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.

""We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,"" he said. ""In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.""

NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the ""short straws in life.""

Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.

The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.

He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly shown his ability"" to deploy capital.

""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.

Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.

Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.

Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.

Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.

""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.

'FISCAL FOLLY'

This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.

""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.

Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.

""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.

Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.

Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""

The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.
In discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.

""We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,"" he said. ""In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.""

2025-03-20,Apple's 'Siri-Ous' Problem - Here's Why I'm Bearish on AAPL,"Okay, Apple fans (or Cook loyalists), let me finish before you go on a rampage. I'm not putting down Apple's products - the iPhone did change the world, and Siri ...... well, at least the way we interact with our phones. But today, we're talking about stocks, and AAPL is looking more and more like a “shareholder-funded AI experiment”.



Apple's growth is slowing, iPhone sales are weak, and the company's attempts to boost demand with AI features like Apple Intelligence have frequently skipped a beat, with Siri's AI upgrade pushed back to 2026 or possibly even later, and iOS 18's bugs making the user experience even worse. Meanwhile, rivals like Google and Amazon have made significant strides in the AI assistant space.



To make matters worse, Apple's valuation is already ridiculously high, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29x, well above the S&P 500's 20x. That's clearly unsustainable given its single-digit growth expectations. The irony is that Cook seems to be focusing more on growth in the services business, while innovation in the iPhone as a core product has been weak. So why exactly is this company still worth so much money? How do you see Apple's future? Is it time to reassess its valuation?

2025-03-21,Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase,"Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.

According to a report in the Information, Apple — which just shed around $700 billion as a result of Wall Street's latest tech rout — has consistently spent over $5 billion annually to beef up its content slate since launching in 2019. That number, though, dramatically decreased to just about $500 million last year, the report said.

Apple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.

The update comes as many media giants have pulled back on spending in favor of profitability. More streaming platforms are cracking down on password sharers and have also bundled their respective offerings to prevent churn, or users abandoning their subscription plans.

Last year, Apple partnered with Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) to launch a new bundle dubbed StreamSaver, exclusively available to Comcast broadband internet service customers for a cost of $15 a month. The monthly price of a solo Apple TV+ subscription currently sits at $9.99, although users can bundle Apple's streaming service with other Apple-related products like Apple Arcade and Apple News+.

It's unclear whether the recent bundles are helping.

According to data compiled by subscription analytics platform Antenna, Apple's streaming service had the highest churn percentage of all the major streaming platforms, with the exclusion of Starz, with 7% of users churning out of the service during the month of February, compared to just 2% of users for Netflix and 4% of users for Disney+.

Notably, Apple has adopted a strategy different from that of its competitors. For one, its content slate is more limited, although it does boast highly acclaimed titles, including award-winning series like ""Severance,"" ""Shrinking,"" and ""Ted Lasso."" It was also the first streaming platform to take home an Oscar win for best picture (thanks to ""Coda"").

In total, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins, CEO Tim Cook said on the company's January earnings call.

Apple TV+ does not release subscriber figures, although analysts have pegged total users at anywhere from 30 million to 40 million. Compared to Netflix, which boasts over 300 million subscribers thanks to its substantial global presence, Apple TV+ does not have high penetration in emerging markets, which have become increasingly important drivers as streaming hits peak saturation levels in the US and Canada.

""Apple's streaming service never set out to be No. 1,"" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance. ""Apple is good at the game that they play, but it's not a mass appeal game. They want to be the creative storytellers. They're more focused.""

In January, Apple reported first quarter earnings that showed all-time highs for services revenue, which includes sales from businesses like Apple TV+, along with the App Store and Apple Music.

Compared to Netflix, which boasts over 300 million subscribers thanks to its substantial global presence, Apple TV+ does not have high penetration in emerging markets, which have become increasingly important drivers as streaming hits peak saturation levels in the US and Canada.

""Apple's streaming service never set out to be No. 1,"" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance. ""Apple is good at the game that they play, but it's not a mass appeal game. They want to be the creative storytellers. They're more focused.""

In January, Apple reported first quarter earnings that showed all-time highs for services revenue, which includes sales from businesses like Apple TV+, along with the App Store and Apple Music. Revenue for the division climbed to $26.34 billion for the period, compared to $23.12 billion in the prior year.",1328,218
2025-03-31,Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase,"Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.

According to a report in the Information, Apple — which just shed around $700 billion as a result of Wall Street's latest tech rout — has consistently spent over $5 billion annually to beef up its content slate since launching in 2019. That number, though, dramatically decreased to just about $500 million last year, the report said.

Apple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.

The update comes as many media giants have pulled back on spending in favor of profitability. More streaming platforms are cracking down on password sharers and have also bundled their respective offerings to prevent churn, or users abandoning their subscription plans.

Last year, Apple partnered with Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) to launch a new bundle dubbed StreamSaver, exclusively available to Comcast broadband internet service customers for a cost of $15 a month. The monthly price of a solo Apple TV+ subscription currently sits at $9.99, although users can bundle Apple's streaming service with other Apple-related products like Apple Arcade and Apple News+.

It's unclear whether the recent bundles are helping.

According to data compiled by subscription analytics platform Antenna, Apple's streaming service had the highest churn percentage of all the major streaming platforms, with the exclusion of Starz, with 7% of users churning out of the service during the month of February, compared to just 2% of users for Netflix and 4% of users for Disney+.

Notably, Apple has adopted a strategy different from that of its competitors. For one, its content slate is more limited, although it does boast highly acclaimed titles, including award-winning series like ""Severance,"" ""Shrinking,"" and ""Ted Lasso."" It was also the first streaming platform to take home an Oscar win for best picture (thanks to ""Coda"").

In total, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins, CEO Tim Cook said on the company's January earnings call.

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",215,62

U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a series of sweeping tariffs on countries around the world that could drastically alter the landscape of global trade, and consumer goods like iPhones could be among the hardest hit, analysts said on Thursday, with increases of 30% to 40% if the company were to pass on the cost to consumers.

Most iPhones are still made in China, which was hit with a 54% tariff. If those levies persist, Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab has a tough choice: absorb the extra expense or pass it on to customers.

Shares of the company closed down 9.3% on Thursday, hitting their worst day since March 2020.

Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year; its biggest markets include the United States, China and Europe.

The cheapest iPhone 16 model was launched in the U.S. with a sticker price of $799, but could cost as much as $1,142, per calculations based on projections from analysts at Rosenblatt Securities, who say the cost could rise by 43% - if Apple is able to pass that on to consumers.

A more expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max, with a 6.9-inch display and 1 terabyte of storage, which currently retails at $1599, could cost nearly $2300 if a 43% increase were to pass to consumers.

DISCLAIMER: I THINK THEIR PLANS ARE 100% DISTILLED ORGANIC REGARDIUM. HOWEVER, THESE PLANS EXIST; IT ISN'T JUST THE DEATH THROES OF A DEMENTED OLD MAN. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GOALS AND HOW THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE THEM, SO YOU DON'T GET WIPED OUT BY A SINGULAR MANIAC'S AMBITIONS.

  
“I believe very strongly in tariffs. America is being ripped off. We’re a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country.”

\--Donald Trump, 1988



[Transshipment](https://china.ucsd.edu/_files/02072025-brief-identify-tariff-evasion-web.pdf) is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year.

This has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/industry-lawmakers-applaud-president-trumps-section-232-tariffs/), with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of ""loopholes"" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage.

Their goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018:

* [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that ""deindustrialization is a national security risk"".](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan-april-6-2025/) In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787225532&sid=sitemap&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7E3a357c28&aty=open-web-entry) Peter Navarro has said that ""every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait."" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons.
* Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-hudson-institute-event-remarks/) True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world.

So, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/revealed-how-trump-tariffs-slugged-norfolk-island-and-uninhabited-heard-and-mcdonald-islands)\-- closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence.

What does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that ""liberation day"" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to ""buy the dip."" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one.

**\^ this was posted on 2025-04-08 2:12PM ET.**

**""TRUMP HAS NO INTENTION TO KEEP UNJUSTIFIABLY HIGH TARIFFS ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES CHINA"" --me**

**""THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP"" --me**

**""TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD"" --me**

However, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of ""reducing the trade deficit with China"" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and ""reindustrialize"" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.

tl;dr: Since the goal is to ""Reduce the trade deficit with China,"" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.

**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**

I think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.

Who are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...

Navarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is ""ripping off the world."" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.

Are these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:

**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to ""decouple"" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**

**He believes in ""short term pain,"" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the ""dependency"" on China.**

Simply put:

AAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.

However, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the ""apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip"" reflex continues over the rest of the week.

The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and ""reindustrialize"" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.

tl;dr: Since the goal is to ""Reduce the trade deficit with China,"" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.

**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**

I think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.

Who are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...

Navarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is ""ripping off the world."" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.

Are these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:

**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to ""decouple"" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**

**He believes in ""short term pain,"" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the ""dependency"" on China.**

Simply put:

AAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.

However, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the ""apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip"" reflex continues over the rest of the week.

I am convinced there was a lot of overbuying because of misinterpretation and misreporting around the tariff pause, I expect flat trading tomorrow and huge drop on Friday. We have tariffs against China, Europe, and Canada still. There is still 10% baseline tariffs on every country (this was misreported/corrected).

2025-05-02,Apple revenue tops Wall Street expectations but Services division disappoints,"Apple reported second fiscal-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, but the company’s closely-watched Services division came up light versus estimates.  

Here’s how Apple did versus consensus estimates for the quarter ending in March: 

* EPS $1.65 vs. $1.63 estimated by LSEG 

* Revenue: $95.4 billion vs. $94.66 billion estimated by LSEG 

* iPhone revenue: $46.84 billion vs. $45.84 billion estimated, per StreetAccount 

* Mac revenue: $7.95 billion vs. $7.77 billion estimated, per StreetAccount  

* iPad revenue: $6.4 billion vs. $6.20 billion estimated, per StreetAccount 

* Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $7.52 billion vs. $7.95 billion, per StreetAccount 

* Services revenue: $26.65 billion vs. $26.70 billion, per StreetAccount 

* Gross margin: 41.7% vs. 47.1%, per StreetAccount 

The company reported $1.65 per share on $24.78 billion of net income during the quarter, versus $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the year-ago period. 

Apple typically provides data points about how it sees the current quarter shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is highly anticipating CEO Tim Cook’s first public comments on how Apple will navigate rapidly-shifting tariffs proposed by the Trump administration. 

Analysts are looking for third-quarter guidance of $1.48 in earnings per share on $89.45 billion of sales. 

Cook told CNBC that Apple is already sourcing about half of the iPhones for the U.S. from India, and most of its other products for the U.S. from Vietnam, where tariffs are lower than they are from China. Apple still makes the “vast majority” of its products for other countries from China, Cook said.  

“If you look at the U.S., over half of the U.S. sales of iPhone come from India,” Cook said. “If you look at the other products, Mac and iPad and AirPods and the Watch, almost all of the country of origin is Vietnam.” 

Cook said the iPhone uses a lot of chips made domestically, and that Apple is buying 19 billion chips this year from the U.S.  

“With an iPhone, you really have to go a step lower and look at the individual parts and where they come from,” he said.  

Apple said its board authorized up to $100 billion in share repurchases this quarter, down from $110 billion in authorization last year. Apple also said it would pay a dividend of 26 cents per share, a 4% increase. 

“We continue to plan for annual dividend increases,” Cook said.  

The company’s most important product line, iPhones, topped estimates at $46.8 billion in sales during the quarter. The overall product line’s sales were up just under 2% on an annual basis.  

Apple’s profitable Services division includes iCloud subscriptions, services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, warranties and revenue from search licensing deals like its agreement with Google.  

Cook, in a statement, hailed “double-digit” Services growth to $26.65 billion in revenue during the quarter, an annual increase of 11.65%. However, Services revenue came in slightly under StreetAccount expectations, and last year, Apple’s services division grew 14.2% during the March quarter.  

Apple hardware generally did well during the quarter. 

Mac sales rose nearly 7% to just under $8 billion, and iPad sales were up 15% on an annual basis to $6.4 billion. Apple introduced new mid-priced iPad Air and MacBook Air models in March.  

However, Apple’s wearables division, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and accessories sales, declined 5% versus the same period last year to $7.52 billion in revenue. 

Sales in Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, were down slightly year-over-year at $16 billion. Cook said that China sales were accelerating on a quarterly basis, and that Apple sales in the region would have been flat if not for foreign exchange rates.  

On the other hand, sales in the Americas, Apple’s largest market that has seen some increased consumer demand ahead of tariffs, rose nearly 8%. Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that Apple had not seen evidence of order “pull forward” because of tariffs.  

“We don’t believe that there was a significant pull forward due to tariffs into the March quarter,” Cook said. “There’s no obvious evidence of it.”

Apple’s profitable Services division includes iCloud subscriptions, services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, warranties and revenue from search licensing deals like its agreement with Google.  

Cook, in a statement, hailed “double-digit” Services growth to $26.65 billion in revenue during the quarter, an annual increase of 11.65%. However, Services revenue came in slightly under StreetAccount expectations, and last year, Apple’s services division grew 14.2% during the March quarter.  

Apple hardware generally did well during the quarter. 

Mac sales rose nearly 7% to just under $8 billion, and iPad sales were up 15% on an annual basis to $6.4 billion. Apple introduced new mid-priced iPad Air and MacBook Air models in March.  

However, Apple’s wearables division, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and accessories sales, declined 5% versus the same period last year to $7.52 billion in revenue. 

Sales in Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, were down slightly year-over-year at $16 billion. Cook said that China sales were accelerating on a quarterly basis, and that Apple sales in the region would have been flat if not for foreign exchange rates.  

On the other hand, sales in the Americas, Apple’s largest market that has seen some increased consumer demand ahead of tariffs, rose nearly 8%. Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that Apple had not seen evidence of order “pull forward” because of tariffs.  

“We don’t believe that there was a significant pull forward due to tariffs into the March quarter,” Cook said. “There’s no obvious evidence of it.”

2025-05-03,Why is Apple stock dropping after earnings?,,0,17
2025-05-04,APPL analysis for 2025,"Apple's recent 4% dividend increase signals a strong commitment to shareholder value, likely attracting renewed interest from long-term investors. The company's $100 billion stock buyback program, set to commence in 2025, should further bolster investor confidence, enhance share price stability, and support sustained demand for the stock.
To mitigate risks associated with tariffs and reduce reliance on China-centric production, Apple is strategically pivoting its manufacturing operations to countries like Vietnam and India. This diversification aims to alleviate cost pressures from potential trade disruptions and improve supply chain resilience. However, Apple's heavy dependence on China for logistics and production remains a vulnerability, exposing the company to geopolitical and economic risks beyond its control.
A significant external factor is the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. While a potential interest rate cut could stimulate economic growth and benefit equities, an unexpected negative catalyst—such as persistent or rising inflation—could trigger market volatility and exert downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Additionally, escalating tariffs on Chinese imports pose a substantial risk, given Apple's reliance on China for its supply chain logistics.
In summary, while Apple's dividend hike, buyback program, and manufacturing diversification strengthen its long-term outlook, uncertainties surrounding Federal Reserve actions and China-related tariff risks warrant cautious optimism.

2025-05-07,Will Apple’s AI push finally reignite its stock momentum?,"After WWDC24, Apple finally joined the AI race with “Apple Intelligence.” AAPL popped \~5%, but I’m more interested in what comes next—especially the hardware angle.

According to a recent piece I saw via Tiger’s earnings insights, AI features like the new Siri, summarisation, and writing tools will only be available on A17 Pro and M-series chips. Feels like Apple is quietly engineering a forced upgrade cycle, no?

That article also mentioned an interesting stat: nearly 90% of iPhones in use today are older than 15 Pro, which means a huge addressable base for upgrades. If even a fraction converts, it could meaningfully lift ASPs and margins.

  

They just approved a $100B buyback, bumped dividends, and valuation isn’t ridiculous at 27x forward P/E. So the big question:

Is this the start of a new iPhone cycle, or just hype baked into the price already?

 Are you holding AAPL long-term or trimming into strength?",21,20

2025-05-16,Optimistic about AAPL's future performance,"The market’s got some good momentum right now. And yeah, I’ll admit it, Apple’s recent years innovation kinda feels like squeezing the last bit of toothpaste outta the tube. Every new release looks more like a tweak than a breakthrough. But here’s the thing: their ecosystem is just too damn strong. You can complain all you want about the interface barely changing, but once you’re locked into the Apple “walled garden,” it’s almost impossible to leave. Everything just works together so seamlessly—the iPhone, Mac, AirPods, Watch—it becomes part of your life. I get frustrated sometimes, sure, but I still keep buying and am bullish on AAPL long-term and think it’ll bring solid returns. I’m also paying attention to trading plays to catch short-term and long-term opportunities.

Lately I’ve been using AI tools like [TigerAI](https://ttm.financial/gpt?_sasdk=fNDEyMjQxNDAyMTA2NDY5Mg&utm_source=reddit&utm_content=signup&invite=RDCBA&utm_term=stock_analysis) to help analyze stocks. Some of the insights are actually decent, not something I’d blindly follow, but useful as a second opinion. anyone else here using AI tools for trading? How much do you trust the suggestions?

2025-05-21,"After last week's dip, it's high time for AAPL to bounce back: The AI catalyst we're overlooking","Been holding AAPL for years now and honestly,

Last week's market turbulence hit our favorite stock pretty hard, but I'm seeing strong indicators for a significant rebound. While many are focused on macro factors, I believe there's a technological catalyst that's being severely undervalued in Apple's arsenal.

I've been watching Apple closely, and these three strengths make me bullish despite the recent dip:

1. **Vertical integration mastery** \- They design their own chips specifically tailored to their computing needs, consistently placing them in the top 3 across performance categories. This gives them unparalleled control over their technology stack.
2. **Bold product innovation** \- Apple has never let industry conventions limit their vision. When they commit to a direction, they go all-in, regardless of what competitors might think.
3. **Technological leadership** \- While NVIDIA dominates in certain AI computing segments, Apple has quietly developed the highest RAM allocation available to on-device LLMs at the processor level.

Here's what I think most people are missing - Apple's AI play. That rumored **TigerAI** framework they're developing could be the catalyst we've been waiting for. While Google and Microsoft are rushing to slap AI onto everything, Apple's doing what Apple does best - taking their time to integrate it properly into their ecosystem.

We've seen this movie before, right? Apple wasn't first with smartphones, tablets, or watches. But when they entered each market, they dominated. I'm betting the same happens with AI.

I actually added more shares yesterday. This dip doesn't change my long-term outlook - if anything, with what they're building with TigerAI, I'm more confident than ever.

What do you guys think? Am I overhyping their AI potential or is this the real deal that'll push us back to ATHs?",20,32

I predict Apple will not have other major news related to AI, for fear of getting righly roasted for promising big and under delivering, like happened last year related to Apple Intelligence launch.

What I would love to see but don't expect:  Apple incorporating Perplexity, Gemini, and ChatGPT directly into Safari search results, with the user being able to quickly toggle between different AI search engine results without having to re-type the same query over again. 

What are your predictions?

2025-05-24,"Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq trim losses as Trump threatens new tariffs on Apple and EU","U.S. stocks fell Friday and were on track to record a weekly loss as investors assessed the potential impact of President Trump's latest tariff threats and his massive tax bill on the deficit and economy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( \^DJI ) fell 0.3 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 ( \^GSPC ) also fell about 0.3 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( \^IXIC ) was down about 0.6 percent.

Apple Inc (AAPL) must pay a 25 percent tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. but not made in the U.S., Trump said on Friday, and all three major stock indexes trimmed their losses sharply. The tech giant has begun shifting some of its manufacturing operations to India, while China, home to its main suppliers, is mired in a trade war with the United States. Apple shares fell 3 percent after Trump's tweet on Truth Social.

On Friday afternoon, Trump hinted that the tariffs would apply to other cellphone makers.

Trump told reporters Friday afternoon: ""The tariffs are going to be higher, and Samsung and any company that makes that product is going to be affected, or it's not fair. Again, they don't have tariffs on building factories here. That's why they'll build a factory here.""

Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on EU imports “right up to 50 percent” as of June 1, as trade talks between China and Europe have stalled.",118,29

And also fit with the narrative that we are mimicking the past forgot which year but 170 range will mark what looks to be a double bottom.,0,46
2025-06-04,"AAPL holding strong at $200 support, my favorite big tech play right now","Among all the big tech stocks in my portfolio, $AAPL remains my personal favorite. Sure, it doesn't offer a high dividend yield, but the stability in price movement is what keeps me coming back.
I've been relatively quiet with trading in April and May, but looking back at my transaction history, I noticed I made several sales in the $206-213 range. Based on this pattern, I'm planning my next exit strategy around the $207 mark.

What's interesting is that Apple is the only major tech company that hasn't approached its 200-day moving average and has been somewhat left out of the broader market rally. But here's the thing about Apple - it has this uncanny ability to bounce back when you least expect it. Sometimes when everyone gets tired and starts selling, that's exactly when AAPL decides to moon.
I learned this lesson the hard way last year when I got impatient and sold too early, only to watch it surge afterward. That's a mistake I won't make again.

The $200 level is proving to be solid support, and the back-and-forth action between bulls and bears over the past two months has actually been pretty entertaining to watch.

For those looking to get into AAPL or any other stocks, I've been using Tiger Brokers lately - their platform makes it easy to track these support levels with clean charts and real-time data. Plus, you can start with fractional shares from just $1, which is perfect for building positions gradually around key levels like this $200 support.

Anyone else eyeing this support level for an entry point?

2025-06-06,WWDC 2025 is next week  Can Apple finally deliver something real in AI?,"Apple’s big developer conference kicks off June 9, and Wall Street is *watching closely* — especially with the AI hype still going strong.

Last year, Apple teased us with “Apple Intelligence,” their own take on generative AI. Big demos, big promises... but not much follow-through. Siri still isn’t GPT-level, and most of the AI features we *did* get have been kind of meh.

So what should we expect this year?

Here’s a quick rundown:

 iOS/macOS/iPadOS are getting a major design overhaul, reportedly inspired by the Vision Pro’s visionOS. Mark Gurman says it’s the biggest visual revamp since iOS 7.

 AI features in smaller doses  like an intelligent battery manager that learns your habits, and live translation for AirPods (finally catching up to Google). But don’t expect ChatGPT-style magic just yet.

 Apple might open its own LLMs to devs, allowing on-device AI apps. That could be a big deal long-term if devs jump in.

 New unified gaming app  looks like Apple wants to get serious about gaming. Still miles away from console-level stuff, but their App Store is already a mobile gaming monster.

Also, the iPhone 17 is rumored to be thinner and lighter**,** and paired with the new OS could help reignite sales in China  where Apple’s been struggling for a few quarters now.

Bottom line: Apple might not blow minds like last year, but if the software updates are slick enough and the AI stuff feels *usable*, it could be enough to get AAPL back in the good graces of investors.",32,15

2025-06-08,NVDA did it so will AAPL,"Very interesting positioning into next week. 
$SPY closed the week right at $600 psychological level, a clean breakout spot.

$AAPL Closed above the apex of the months long triangle wedge = technical breakout 

If WWDC delivers real AI substance, Apple could begin to outperform the market even lead SPY to new highs

Breakdown: why retesting or getting near the upper wedge ($230 area) is critical:

⸻

The Significance of the Upper Descending Broadening Wedge

1. Multiple Touch = Valid Trendline
	•	Apple’s upper wedge line has 2+ major rejection points (circled), confirming its validity.
	•	A third or fourth touch, especially after a breakout from a tighter wedge, is textbook price behavior — the market respects these levels before it decides.

2. $230 is a Psychological & Technical Target
	•	It aligns with the measured move of the triangle breakout.
	•	Also acts as a “magnet” zone where sellers previously controlled, and where institutions may want to re-evaluate risk.

3. NVDA = Patience Before Explosion
	•	NVDA’s price knocked on the wedge ceiling 3x (Jan 7, Jan 24, Feb 18), just like Apple is lining up to do.
	•	Only after testing it enough — and building higher lows beneath it — did NVDA explode above.
	•	Once it cleared the wedge, NVDA never looked back, running over 100% in months.",22,20

2025-06-10,Apple is a sell for me.,"The WWDC conference is so bad and embarrassing for a tech giant like apple. Cool guys, you have introduced liquid glass, but that doesn't make you a strong AI competitor..

If you partner with chatgpt, that only proves that as a big tech company you have no leverage because you do not have a superior In house AI technology that rivals openAi and Gemini. This is very concerning in my view for Apple stock. 

The AI race is so competitive that if apple.comes up with a new model In the near future, it wouldn't cut it any more. They have to be the best, and they don't even have anything worth noting currently. 

As a big tech company if you have no leverage, you'll be dethroned. 

I sold all my apple shares. I do not care about the marketing mumbo jumbo.

Not a great look, especially with the broader tech space trying to shake off regulatory heat.

What’s interesting is that while their core products remain strong, these legal challenges are starting to pile up, and it feels like investor sentiment is getting more cautious. Some analysts are still bullish, but you can tell the mood is shifting a bit.

2025-06-18,"Apple is resilient, but stock buybacks are diverting capital from its moat","As a longtime Apple customer, I deeply understand its value proposition. However, management is facing a declining moat from the disruptive growth of artificial intelligence in the hardware space, which poses a price-return risk.

2025-06-24,"Apple is resilient, but stock buybacks are diverting capital from its moat","As a longtime Apple customer, I deeply understand its value proposition. However, management is facing a declining moat from the disruptive growth of artificial intelligence in the hardware space, which poses a price-return risk. Management would be wise at this point to focus less on stock buybacks and more on effectively investing cash flow into more aggressive M&A and better R&D talent. I predict Apple stock will return 10% annually over the next 12 months. I also predict Apple will return 10% annually over the next 10 years as well.

AAPL has been relatively weak so far in 2025. As of June 17, shares were trading at $195.64, down $2.83 intraday (-1.43%) Cumulatively, the year-to-date decline is about 20%, making it one of the worst-performing tech giants in MAG7

In the last month, the stock price has oscillated between $196 and $202 since the end of May, and is still below the key 50-day SMA of $205.69 and the 200-day SMA of $225.74, indicating that medium- to long-term downward pressure still exists.From a fundamental standpoint, Apple achieved revenue of $95.4 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, up 5% year-over-year Diluted earnings per share of $1.65, up 8% year-over-year, both of which exceeded Wall Street's expectations

The stock price is currently in the vicinity of 193 U.S. dollars has important support, if broken may further test the 180 U.S. dollars line, and above the key resistance in the 214-216 U.S. dollars range, once recovered will be expected to regain the momentum of the rebound if the AAPL fell to 193-190 U.S. dollars range,

can be considered to take a small position in the low batch of buying, using the average support area for short-term rebound arbitrage. If AAPL falls to $193-190, you can consider taking small positions to buy in low batches and take advantage of the SMA support area for short-term rebound arbitrage. If the price can recover $205-206 and stabilize above it, it can open up space for a larger rally.",77,63
2025-06-25,Apple may acquire Perplexity for $14 billion? Thought?,"
1. Perplexity is reportedly valued at $14 billion — if the deal goes through, it would be Apple's largest acquisition ever, nearly 4.7 times its previous record: the $3 billion Beats acquisition.

2. Beats currently holds the top spot at $3 billion, followed by HopStop at $110 million, and Intel’s modem business at $100 million. Most other Apple acquisitions have been below $110 million, making the potential Perplexity deal unprecedented in scale.

3. The move signals Apple’s intensified push into AI, aiming to acquire cutting-edge technology and key talent through high-stakes M&A.

4. While such a high-premium deal comes with integration risks, it could significantly accelerate Apple’s development of a robust AI ecosystem.

2025-06-26,Apple should spend money to buy innovations ASAP…,"Post earnings call, every time I look at the report, business fundamentals are good. That’s not the problem. Even China revenue dipped by only a tiny bit.

The problem is that Wall St. starting to think that their execs are boomers who don’t get new technology. They are stingy to a fault. They really should spend money to buy some companies even if their profits are not there yet. Money should be no object.

If they buy Rivian and Enphase, it will send signals that they are ready to eat the electrification market share. It will also send signals that they are ready to eat the car market share. Something that is core to American lifestyle.

If they buy Antrophic, it will send signals that they take AI seriously and ready for the next decade of growth.

To balance the buying, Apple should also make their chips datacenter ready. They have all the ingredients to compete B2B with Nvidia. Container/VM story is there. Spend the extra engineering effort to optimize their GPU for Containerized Linux. Bam. That’s it.

Apple needs a growth story, not fundamentals. Through new SKUs. Mac and iPad will never break double digit billion per quarter.",48,32

They only have upside, as I am confident that there will be a tariff relief rally, and their Foundations Models Framework presented at WDC25 is the true game changer. While everyone was crapping on AAPL for their Liquid Glass Interface (which is an optional setting), the herd totally missed the real play here - Foundations Models is like electricity for AI. You don't build a power plant to run your business—you just plug into the grid - Apple just became the grid for AI developers. In other words, with developers now having enterprise-AI within the apple ecosystem, then apps will become so much more enhanced because they will be ingrained in daily life. Every intelligent iOS app becomes a reason why users won't switch. And it's worth way more than any AI subscription would be. As usual Apple is late to the party. But, First to win!",17,20

Apple (Apple) supply chain sources revealed:
In June, Apple began the prototype phase (P1 – Prototype 1) of the foldable iPhone. It is expected that the prototype development process will be completed by the end of 2025, after which it will enter the EVT (Engineering Verification Test) phase. According to this timeline, the foldable iPhone is likely to be launched in the second half of 2026.

Supply chain sources also stated that Apple’s original new product planning included not only a foldable iPhone but also a larger foldable iPad.

As of now, it is expected that the foldable iPhone will be launched first, while the foldable iPad is temporarily shelved. The delay is reportedly due to difficulties in component production (such as display panels), high estimated prices, and potentially low market acceptance.

There have been many rumors about a foldable iPhone in the past, but they have all remained in the “rumor-only” stage. Now that almost all Android brands have already released foldable phones, Apple’s supply chain has finally been activated.

Industry insiders revealed that this product has already been in development for more than 5 years, with the number of design revisions exceeding double digits. Suppliers had remained cautious, but now finally believe it has a “real chance” to reach the market.",24,29

2025-07-04,Can Apple's AI pivot help it escape last place among tech giants?,"Apple's recent consideration of partnering with Anthropic or OpenAI for Siri development has caught my attention. This strategic shift feels significant, especially as it might signal a pause in their internal AI model development. I'm curious whether this move could help Apple catch up in the AI race and finally bring some innovation to the somewhat stagnant Siri.

From a technical perspective, Apple has seen two consecutive days of gains, breaking above its 50-day moving average. This makes me wonder if we're seeing the early signs of a potential breakout. It's a positive signal that has me more optimistic about the stock's potential, particularly given this technical indicator's performance.

However, I can't ignore the fact that Apple ranks second-to-last among the tech giants year-to-date. This ranking concerns me because it highlights how the company has been struggling to keep pace while the broader market continues hitting new highs. I'm wondering if now might be Apple's time to catch up, and I'm eager to see how these latest developments, including potential AI partnerships, will impact its performance in the coming months.

For opportunities like this technical breakout, I've been using tigerCBA for trading, which is particularly useful when I spot opportunities but my funds aren't immediately available. This trade-first, settle-later approach allows me to better capitalize on market timing.

2025-07-27,AAPL Is Poised to Rip Post-Earnings (And Why I'm All In),"**TL;DR:** Apple’s firing on all cylinders: Services growth, AI bets, supply chain shifts, and strong global demand. Still a fortress of stability and upside in a chaotic market.

1. **Services = Cash Machine** Apple’s Services segment hit a record $26.6B last quarter (up 11.6% YoY), now making up 28% of revenue. With a 92% retention rate and built-in recurring cash flow, this high-margin biz gives Apple stability beyond hardware.
2. **AI Is Rough Now… But the Next Big Thing?** Apple Intelligence (yeah, it’s basic now) sets the stage for iPhone 16/17 upgrade cycles. Think enhanced Siri, Image Playground, and privacy-first AI via Private Cloud Compute. Analysts estimate AI could add $5–7B to Services revenue by 2026.
3. **Smart Supply Chain Moves** Shifting production to India & Vietnam helps Apple de-risk from China dependency. A $900M tariff hit is coming, but long-term, it builds resilience and global availability.

2025-07-29,AAPL is moving higher as markets react positively to a new US-EU trade deal that eases trade war concerns ahead of earnings," Apple is gaining traction today following the announcement of a new US-EU trade agreement that has eased investor concerns around a potential trade war. With AAPL’s earnings just around the corner, the timing of this geopolitical boost couldn’t be better.

The agreement could streamline Apple’s transatlantic operations and reduce cost pressures, especially as the company continues expanding its supply chain footprint in Europe. Combined with broader anticipation around big tech earnings this week, the trade news has added fuel to AAPL’s upward momentum.

2025-07-30,AAPL: Will Thursday’s Earnings Justify the Hype?,"Apple reports fiscal Q3 earnings this Thursday after the market closes, and analysts are broadly optimistic:

* Revenue is projected at $89.34 billion, a 4% year-over-year increase.

* iPhone sales are expected to hit $40.23 billion (+2%), with services forecast at $26.82 billion (+11%).

* The average price target stands at $233, about 9% above current levels. Goldman Sachs is even more bullish at $251.

Fall’s upcoming AI features, including live translation, are fueling expectations for an upgrade cycle. If Apple delivers in line with—or above—these expectations, it could reinforce the stock’s recent momentum. 

But a miss, particularly on iPhone or services growth, may undercut the bullish sentiment heading into the critical holiday product cycle.

2025-08-01,"Apple's ""Underperformance"" Is The Opportunity","You all know how bullish I am on Apple despite the hate, but here is my updated thesis from my post a few weeks ago. Position is highlighted below

**TL;DR:** Apple's strategic foundation as stronger than ever. Services growth, a privacy-first AI platform, and a diversified supply chain position it for a massive run. Despite short-term headwinds, confidence in the long-term thesis is fully warranted.

**Services = $$$$** Apple’s Services segment continues to be a fortress of stability. With a record-breaking $26.6B last quarter and expectations for continued strength in today's earnings, this high-margin business is growing its contribution to total revenue. With over one billion paid subscriptions, its recurring, high-retention cash flow gives Apple a foundation to weather any market volatility.

**AI Strategy… Only up from here?** The introduction of Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute sets the stage for the next iPhone upgrade cycle. This privacy-first AI platform, fully integrated into the ecosystem, provides a compelling reason for the company's vast install base to upgrade to the iPhone 16/17 series. While a specific analyst estimate of a $5–7B revenue boost by 2026 was not found, the market widely agrees this will be a significant, multi-billion dollar tailwind for Services.

**Supply Chain Diversification** Apple’s strategic shift of production to India and Vietnam is actively de-risking the business from its dependence on China and mitigating future tariff impacts. This move, while incurring some short-term costs, is a crucial long-term strategy that builds a more resilient and geographically diversified supply chain.

The latest remarks from former President Trump have revived fears of higher import costs, which could pressure Apple’s supply chain and pricing strategy.

While Apple’s recent earnings showed resilience, broader economic uncertainty and the potential for softer consumer demand are weighing on sentiment. With tariffs and macro headwinds back in focus, investors are taking a more cautious stance ahead of the next economic and trade developments.

Do you think these tariff fears will fade quickly, or could they become a bigger drag on AAPL into year end?",33,32

Apple just reported 10% revenue growth and 12% profit growth. 

All those anti-trust lawsuits in the US will go away. Tim knows the game.

But the main reason to keep investing in Apple:

Apple has over a BILLION super loyal customers who continue to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars on Apple products. They are stuck in the Apple ecosystem. The customer retention rate has to be 90-95%. Younger generations love Apple products. 

No other company has this type of brand loyalty at such a massive scale that is willing to spend big dollars. ",0,29
2025-08-08,AAPL Thesis = Confirmed,"You all know how bullish I’ve been on Apple even when sentiment was weak, but now that earnings are out, the thesis I posted weeks ago is playing out exactly as expected. The post-earnings action just confirmed everything. Position still intact and as confident as ever, **HA suck it H8ters**

**TL;DR:** Apple’s recent underperformance was driven by market-wide AI hype elsewhere, but the fundamentals never wavered. With a record breaking Services quarter, continued execution on privacy-first AI, and a long term supply chain strategy gaining momentum, Apple’s setup has only improved.

**Services = Still ⛽️**: Apple’s Services segment once again proved it’s the most stable part of the business. With $23.9B in Q3 revenue (a new all-time high) and over one billion paid subscriptions, this high-margin, recurring-revenue engine continues to scale. As other companies chase AI monetization stories, Apple is quietly turning its install base into predictable cash flow. This is the foundation of the long-term thesis — and it’s working.

**AI Lag Was the Setup**: While names like Microsoft, Meta, and Google rallied off AI driven beats, Apple was left out of the party. That created the opportunity. Apple Intelligence may not have wowed traders on announcement day, but it’s fully integrated, privacy-first, and designed to drive upgrades, not just headlines. 

**Supply Chain Diversification**: The post earnings macro boost wasn’t just about the top line. Apple committed another $100B to U.S. manufacturing, bringing total domestic investment to $600B. This comes alongside its ongoing shift to India and Vietnam (all part of the same strategic move to derisk from China and reduce tariff exposure). That long term planning is being rewarded now, as the company positions itself to navigate policy and geopolitics better than most.

**Earnings Beat = Thesis Confirmed**: Apple posted $94B in revenue and $1.57 in EPS, beating expectations across the board. iPhone revenue grew 13.5% YoY, Services hit a record, and the company saw a solid stock reaction with follow-through in the days after. The stock’s underperformance wasn’t about the business it was about narratives. This quarter flipped the script.

2025-08-09,Cook just dodged a $100B tariff bullet - thoughts on AAPL's next move?,"Honestly, I didn't expect Cook to pull this off so smoothly. AAPL jumped 5%+ after announcing their American Manufacturing Program while I watched other chipmakers get absolutely wrecked by Trump's 100% semiconductor tariff threat. What impresses me most is how they're not just blindly reshoring everything - they're keeping the expensive fab work in the US but still outsourcing assembly to stay competitive. Meanwhile companies like Renesas are bleeding because they bet everything on staying overseas.

I've been tracking this trend on tiger and other platforms, and the market is clearly rewarding any company with a US manufacturing story right now. My take? This isn't just about dodging tariffs - Cook essentially just reset the entire semiconductor supply chain playbook. Every other chipmaker is now scrambling to announce their own US plans or risk getting left behind. The crazy part is Apple gets to claim ""Made in America"" while still keeping costs reasonable through their hybrid approach. Wonder if this forces other FAANG companies to follow suit with their own manufacturing strategies.",47,23

Back in 2018, Apple ($AAPL) was riding high and telling investors that China wasn’t a problem for iPhone sales. Tim Cook even said they were feeling pressure in places like Brazil, India, Russia, and Turkey — but not China. Then suddenly, just two months later, Apple shocked everyone by slashing its revenue forecast by $9 billion, blaming weak demand in China.

That revelation crushed $AAPL stock by about 10% in a single day. Investors then filed a lawsuit, claiming Apple misled them about how badly iPhone sales in China were hit by the trade war, cheaper battery swaps, and local competition.

Now here’s the update — Apple has agreed to settle for $490 million with investors to resolve those claims. The class period runs from November 2, 2018 to January 2, 2019.

Analysts also expect updates to Apple Watch and AirPods, alongside iterative improvements to processors, cameras, and displays on the new iPhone models. The announcement follows recent launches from Samsung and Google, both pushing foldable big-screen phones, while Apple is rumored to be preparing its own folding iPhone for late next year. 

On the news, AAPL rose 1% to close at 229.31, though BofA cautioned the reveal could become a classic “sell-the-news” event as shares remain in a 35-week consolidation with a buy point at 260.10.",32,17

So, last year, Apple agreed to cough up $490M to settle a lawsuit from investors who say Tim Cook & Luca Maestri basically sugar-coated iPhone demand back in 2018. Shareholders hace only a few more weeks to file a claim and get compensation.

**Here’s the tea:**

* Nov 2018, Apple told Wall Street iPhones were off to a “really great start” and China was “very strong.”
* Reality? Store traffic in China was dropping, suppliers were told to cut production, and demand was softening fast.
* Days later, reports leaked that Apple was slashing iPhone production by 100k per day.
* Fast forward to Jan 2019, and Apple admits its first revenue shortfall in 15 years, blaming China for most of the $9B guidance cut. Stock tanked 10%, wiping out hundreds of billions in value.

2025-09-16,AAPL Update,"**TLDR** \- I'm an Apple Stan and the market's initial verdict on Apple was ""meh"", but we are setup for a powerful Q4. There is strong iPhone 17 demand, an adjusted services strategy, and a supply chain shift (to gain support of Donny Trump).

* **iPhone 17** \-  The market panicked and wiped $112B off Apple's market cap, but that's a classic case of Wall Street missing the forest for the trees. The ""boring"" launch was really a win IMO. iPhone 17 pre-orders and initial sales are strong and the initial stock drop wasn’t about consumer demand...Say it for the folks in the back  ""it was about investors betting on a ""wow"" moment that wasn’t meant to be"". Classic and Dumb!
* **Services Price Hike Is Working (Quietly)** \- Official numbers around rev aren't out, but Apple's strategy is clear and I think it's likely working. The company is raising prices on individual services like Apple TV+ to make the Apple One bundle a no-brainer. And let me be super clear with my thought process here, this isn't about jacking up prices across the board, it’s a smart move to boost ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) and push subscribers toward the more lucrative bundle, all without sparking massive churn. 
* **AI Developments is a Matter of ""When"" not ""If""** \- Long story short is there will be an AI strategy. Apple has never necessarily specialized in building technology, but rather specialized on BEAUTIFUL implementation of that tech. I believe same will be for AI, remember we're still so early on as it relates to enterprise/consumer AI use, why dump massive amounts of R&D into tech that will likely shift within the next 6-12 months. Let the baseline be established, then capitalize on work of large firms who will inevitability fail with some of their AI products.
* **The Supply Chain & US Investment Story** \- Go read about it. It's a smart decision.

2025-09-16,iPhone 17 preorders fuel Apple stock gains despite China hiccup,"Apple shares ticked up to $236.70 after analysts flagged stronger-than-expected demand for the iPhone 17 lineup. Wedbush estimates preorders are running 5–10% ahead of last year, with around 20% of Apple’s 1.5B users overdue for an upgrade. 

Demand is skewing toward the Pro and Pro Max models, where shipping times have stretched to 18–25 days — longer than last year’s cycle. While the A19 chip brings a 20% speed boost, the phones notably lack AI features, and the China launch of the iPhone Air is delayed pending eSIM licensing.

Analyst Mark Newman argues that Apple’s strategy of keeping Apple Intelligence tasks local to devices such as the iPhone and Mac improves security, privacy, and performance—giving Apple an edge over rivals.

Despite lagging competitors in AI and delays in revamping Siri, Bernstein expects Apple to capitalize on new form factors like Apple Glass and smart rings to expand adoption of AI.

Still, the optimism comes as Apple continues to deal with the overhang of its [$490M settlement](https://11th.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement) tied to misleading investors about iPhone demand in China (they're accepting claims for a few more weeks).

[Source: ProFactorInvest Dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/vcxaypfpj3sf1.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e4447f6e419c3f915741f65444be8e022cb8e3c)

* **📉 Valuation:** Apple trades at a premium. Earnings yield is **2.6%**, earnings-to-price **3.8%**, book-to-price **1.7%**, revenue-to-price **10.7%**, and cash flow-to-price **2.9%** — all indicating limited value and a rich valuation.
* **📈 Growth:** Revenue grew **7.2%**, earnings **2.1%**, and projected earnings growth is **9.3%**. Growth remains positive but shows the company’s maturing business profile.
* **💰 Profitability:** Apple’s strength. Return on equity is **154.9%**, return on assets **29.9%**, net profit margin **24.3%**, and ROIC **47.6%**, all world-class figures.
* **⚖️ Debt Structure:** Balance sheet is strong. Debt-to-market cap is **2.7%**, debt-to-equity **154.5%**, and debt-to-assets **30.7%**, all manageable levels.
* **📊 Momentum:** Momentum is stable and positive, with strong short-term performance (**3M: +24.5%**) and solid medium- and long-term trends (**6M: +17.2%**, **12M: +12.9%**).
* **🧱 Stability:** Revenue volatility (**12.8%**) and earnings volatility (**4.5%**) indicate stable cash flows.
* **💸 Dividend:** Yield is modest at **0.4%** (5Y avg. **0.5%**), but a **15.5%** payout ratio leaves room for future increases.
* **🧠 Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts are neutral (**Rating: 2.0**) with price potential at **-4.8%**.

✅ **Conclusion:** Apple remains a *profitability powerhouse* with stable fundamentals and positive momentum. However, its expensive valuation and moderate growth suggest that **future returns could be steady but not spectacular**.

The stock has been riding a strong wave recently with the iPhone 17 demand pushing momentum higher, so this kind of pullback feels pretty normal.

What is interesting is how $AAPL keeps finding ways to stay in the spotlight when people start saying the tech rally is over. Even with today’s dip, it is still sitting near recent highs and holding strong compared to a lot of other big tech names that have been choppy.

Personally, i still hold Apple in my portfolio, but i have also diversified into trading some stock futures on CEXes. It gives me another angle to manage risk and keep exposure flexible while watching how these big names move. On top of that, i am anticipating to enter Bitget’s TSLA event, since it looks like another interesting opportunity alongside my regular stock plays.

Feels like one of those moments where the stock is just consolidating before the next move. Whether you are bullish or cautious, Apple seems to remind the market it is not done yet.

Anyone else seeing this dip as a quick cooldown, or do you think it signals something bigger for tech going into Q4?",7,27

2025-09-30,$AAPL: NLRB Drops Cook Email Case,"So, last week, [Apple received some regulatory relief](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-labor-board-withdraws-claims-203755086.html) as the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) dropped allegations that CEO Tim Cook violated workers’ rights in a 2021 memo warning against leaks. 

The decision removes a high-profile labor challenge, even as Apple continues to face scrutiny over labor practices and transparency (like the whole [case](https://11th.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement) against Apple for misleading statements over iPhone demand in China).



**TL;DR:**

* NLRB dropped claims that Cook’s anti-leak memo broke labor law.
* Labor allegations remain around pay equity and workplace suppression.
* $490M settlement tied to misleading investors on China iPhone demand.
* On Jan 3, 2019, $AAPL fell 10% after cutting revenue forecast by $9B.
* Apple stock remains under legal and reputational scrutiny despite strong fundamentals.



So, do you think that Apple is finally catching a break on the labor front, or just dodging one bullet?
