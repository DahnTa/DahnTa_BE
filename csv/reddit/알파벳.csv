2024-10-15,Google to buy nuclear power for AI datacentres in ‘world first’ deal,"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/15/google-buy-nuclear-power-ai-datacentres-kairos-power

Google has signed a “world first” deal to buy energy from a fleet of mini nuclear reactors to generate the power needed for the rise in use of artificial intelligence.

The US tech corporation has ordered six or seven small nuclear reactors (SMRs) from California’s Kairos Power, with the first due to be completed by 2030 and the remainder by 2035.

Google hopes the deal will provide a low-carbon solution to power datacentres, which require huge volumes of electricity.

The US company, owned by Alphabet, said nuclear provided “a clean, round-the-clock power source that can help us reliably meet electricity demands”.

The explosive growth of generative AI, as well as cloud storage, has increased tech companies’ electricity demands.

Last month, Microsoft struck a deal to take energy from Three Mile Island, activating the plant for the first time in five years. The site, in Pennsylvania, was the location of the most serious nuclear meltdown in US history, in March 1979. Amazon bought a datacentre powered by nuclear energy in March from Talen Energy.

The locations of the new plants and financial details of the agreement were not revealed. Google has agreed to buy a total of 500 megawatts of power from Kairos, which was founded in 2016 and is building a demonstration reactor in Tennessee, due to be completed in 2027.

Michael Terrell, the senior director for energy and climate at Google, said: “The grid needs new electricity sources to support AI technologies that are powering major scientific advances, improving services for businesses and customers, and driving national competitiveness and economic growth.

“This agreement helps accelerate a new technology to meet energy needs cleanly and reliably, and unlock the full potential of AI for everyone.”

2024-10-28,PYPL & CROX earnings play (feat. 2 bonus lotto gambles),"Big fucking week ahead guys, look at the earnings calendar: AMD, GOOG, SNAP, RDDT, MSFT, META, COIN, HOOD, ETSY, UBER, PTON, AMZN, AAPL, INTC—all reporting this week. Let me lube you guys up with a small play this monday to get in the mood.

Today I got 2 earnings plays for y'all: **Crocs** and **PayPal**, both reporting tomorrow before the open. I also have 2 bonus lotto plays on 2 no-name trash companies that report today after the bell; they’ll be in the TLDR at the bottom.

1. **CROX** \- In my last post, I opened a long position on DECK since I noticed a big trend with Uggs all over social media, and it paid off. Now I'm seeing the same thing with Crocs. People don’t care that they look like shit anymore; they think it's fashion now. You know those charms you put in the holes of Crocs? Every kid wants them these days. They don’t realize you can get the exact same charms from China for 5% of the price. That’s what I did, and I’ve been rocking the same Crocs for 6 years now. Those crocodiles know how to make shoes man...... Also McDonalds put mini Crocs toys in their happy meals. Expect green dildos.
2. **PYPL -** PayPal is notorious for having big expectations but then underdelivering. Mfs are trading at a 52W high right now, really poised for a big correction. Apple pay, Google pay, Adyen, Stripe, Square—they're all getting a slice of the cake now. Intel nana is praying for PayPal's downfall. Do not be surprised if this stock goes tits up.

**tldr:  PYPL go down, CROX go up**

**bonus plays:** I'm shorting both **CDNS** (Cadence Design Systems), and **AMKR** (Amkor Technology). Smaller position.

2024-11-01,Alphabet Deserves A Better Valuation,"**I had recommended Alphabet (GOOG)** [**as a great long-term buy at $150**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anr3id/alphabet_goog_150_looks_like_an_excellent_long/), several months ago.

Last evening, Google knocked it out of the park with really stellar results. I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy.

I believe analysts’ consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins.

Google's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons.

* It has a near monopoly in Search
* Market leadership in media with YouTube.
* A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.
* A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS.

**Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.**

Let's take a closer look at Q3 earnings.

Q3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.**

Revenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%.

Consolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business.

Google Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads.

**Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.**

Google Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months.

Cloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more.

Based on consensus analysts’ estimates Alphabet’s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that’s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple‘s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google’s 22. Alphabet’s P/E is closer to the S&P 500’s P/E of 21!

I believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation.

Besides the strong EPS, a lot of Google’s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin.

The antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision.

**I recommend Alphabet as a buy at $176**",334,167

2024-11-12,Give your opinion on my DCF analysis on different companies,"I've done a Google Sheets table where I do valuation on different companies so that I am able to get to the intrinsic value. I use the TTM Free Cash Flow and project its growth. The assumptions required are Free Cash Flow growth for 2024-2032, discount rate which takes into account time value of money and risk, perpetual growth which means FCF growth after 2032 and lastly I get the intrinsic value. I'll show my table with it's assumptions so you can tell me whether they should realistic or I should adjust some variable to be more realistic. I understand that these assumptions are optimistic but I am also optimistic about the companies so the numbers make sense to me. Discount rate is always 7.75% and Perpetual 3% so I'll just show my assumptions on FCF Growth for 2024-2032 and Intrinsic Value/DCF Price and the current price. I'd love to hear your view and I'll adjust accordingly.

All these stocks are at the highest they’ve ever been basically so maybe not best to buy but who knows if the market will keep climbing so I’ll buy and hold for probably 2 years at least. If I need to hold longer for that I probably can. I’m somewhat new to investing so just wanna see y’all’s thoughts. Should I just wait? That would be timing the market and seems like a bad idea haha.

2024-11-13,"Waymo opens robotaxi service to anyone in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet","Alphabet-owned Waymo is removing the waitlist for its self-driving service in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet.

Starting Tuesday, anyone in LA will be able to use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County, the company said. That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo’s waitlist.

With more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company’s robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.

“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”

The company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday. That’s up from 100,000 in August.

Waymo in September announced that it partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025. The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that’s equipped with custom sensors and an AI “driver.” Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker’s Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.

The Waymo One service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. It has also been used by parents to send their teens to school.

All these stocks are at the highest they’ve ever been basically so maybe not best to buy but who knows if the market will keep climbing so I’ll buy and hold for probably 2 years at least. If I need to hold longer for that I probably can. I’m somewhat new to investing so just wanna see y’all’s thoughts. Should I just wait? That would be timing the market and seems like a bad idea haha.

2024-11-15,"Waymo opens robotaxi service to anyone in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet","Alphabet-owned Waymo is removing the waitlist for its self-driving service in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet.

Starting Tuesday, anyone in LA will be able to use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County, the company said. That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo’s waitlist.

With more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company’s robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.

“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”

The company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday. That’s up from 100,000 in August.

Waymo in September announced that it partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025. The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that’s equipped with custom sensors and an AI “driver.” Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker’s Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.

The Waymo One service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. It has also been used by parents to send their teens to school.

2024-11-25,Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,"For those who were sleeping/partying on the weekend, the following happened:

* DoJ said, Google should divest off Chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
* prohibited from ""acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products""
* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices
* content creators can choose to opt-out of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp. in 2001; the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows, though this case **ultimately resulted in a settlement**. With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.

* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \[Q3 results\]
* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\]
* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices

* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices

2024-12-09,$GOOG the BFTG,"
Regards, grab your tendies and gather around the fire because I’m going to tell you all about *$GOOG* (aka Alphabet) the BFTG (Big Fucking ~~Tech~~ Tendie Giant). I’ll break it down for you because I know you polish that 🧠 real nice so I can’t expect a single wrinkle. 

1. Criminally Low P/E Ratio

While all your other tech darlings are flexing P/E ratios like a hooker in heat, $GOOGL is at 23.4 P/E ratio.

For reference:
* $SPX: >27 P/E (yes, the S&P500)
* $MSFT: >36 P/E
* $AAPL: >39 P/E
* $NVDA: >56 P/E
* $AMZN: >47 P/E
* $TSLA: >106 P/E (Fuck you, for the window lickers in the back)

Remember a “good” P/E ratio is traditionally around 20-25. If you don’t understand then read a fucking book.

2. AI Incumming

Sure, everyone’s talking about OpenAI and ChatGPT, but who’s making real money here? Google owns 90%+ of search traffic (when did you ever hear “yahoo it” or “ask duck duck go”?) and monetizes it like a legal cartel. Once Gemini (+Legacy Bard) gets some improvements and a little lipstick even MORE money. Oh, and don’t forget Google Cloud, which grew revenues 30% YoY last quarter.

3. Santa Rally - Ho Ho Hold Onto Your Bollocks 🎅

Historically, December is green season for big-cap tech. Funds rebalance, and retail apes are YOLOing. The Santa Rally isn’t just a meme; it’s a statistical goldmine. With $GOOG’s recent earnings beat ($28.5B in 3 months), the market’s about to price this in as snow starts falling.

4. Big Tech = Safe Haven

Recession? Inflation? Global chaos? Who cares. Big Tech don’t give a *FUCK*. Ad spending may wobble, but companies will NEVER stop buying Google ads.

5. Buybacks on Steroids

$GOOGL has a $70 BILLION buyback program active, the best part? They’re buying low and will push us even higher.

TL;DR: Google Is The Perfect Combo of Value & Growth.

Historically, December is green season for big-cap tech. Funds rebalance, and retail apes are YOLOing. The Santa Rally isn’t just a meme; it’s a statistical goldmine. With $GOOG’s recent earnings beat ($28.5B in 3 months), the market’s about to price this in as snow starts falling.

4. Big Tech = Safe Haven

Recession? Inflation? Global chaos? Who cares. Big Tech don’t give a *FUCK*. Ad spending may wobble, but companies will NEVER stop buying Google ads.

5. Buybacks on Steroids

$GOOGL has a $70 BILLION buyback program active, the best part? They’re buying low and will push us even higher.

TL;DR: Google Is The Perfect Combo of Value & Growth.

Not financial advice. YOLO as your own risk. I’ll be adding more in two weeks having sold ESPP shares to raise more fire power.

How the fuck do I add a ban-bet? If I’m going to do this properly I might as well add some sauce.

2024-12-18,GOOG vs TSLA: Money Spinner vs Monkeys,"Listen up, you smooth-brained, tendie-chasing, wife’s-boyfriend simping fucks. If you’re ignoring GOOG and still long TSLA, you deserve the ~~portfolio~~ big red dildo that you have.🚀

**GOOG - like a wife on a Wednesday, she’s not going down.**

Alphabet isn’t just Google anymore—it’s the tech overlord running your life, your ads, and the YouTube rabbit holes you waste your life in.

1. While you drool over ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini is out here printing real money while your wife drives away with “Tim from finance”.

2. YouTube = Tendies from all ages: It’s monetizing both the Boomers and Gen Z eyeballs milking them for every cent.

3. Cloud Revenue 🚀 : Google Cloud is up **30%** YoY. They’re catching up to AWS and Azure like a freight train and THERE IS NO SAFE WORD!

4. Weymo, Tokyo, up-go, y’know?

5. It’s Not Even Overpriced (Yet): PE ~26. If you’re still crying that “Big Tech is expensive,” literally just shut the fuck up.

GOOG is a low-risk, high-reward tendie train for monkés who want to stop seeing ~~RED~~ their wife getting trained on the weekends.

**TSLA - The big-Brain Hedge You are still too Dumb to Consider**

Tesla is the most overvalued clown car on the market. It looks like shit, it’s priced like shit and the groupies make it sound like Musk just invented teleportation, cured baldness, and colonized Mars simultaneously. **Spoiler Alert! >!He didn’t!<.**

1. When the Market loses hype momentum, TSLA Gets Nuked ☠️ . Overvalued growth names like Tesla get slapped like a hookers cheeks behind Wendy’s, especially if JPow pulls the wrong face.

2. Buying OTM put spreads is a small cost to hedge your brainless GOOG upside. If TSLA drops 20%, you’re eating so many tendies you’ll need a stairmaster to get to bed.

**TLDR** **GOOG Calls** Buy it, hold it, shut up. It’s free money. **TSLA Put Spreads** Buy a cheap put spread. If the market slips, TSLA dumps, and you get paid.

If the market moons, GOOG wins. If the market dies, TSLA pays for your next YOLO. Either way, you’re not left high and dry like the rest of the regards here.

Don’t fumble this you fucking idiot.

When It arrived I noticed on a NEST video the delivery driver doing something weird, after placing the box, he turned it around, in hindsight this was to allow to hide the package was already open.

He took his picture [https://imgur.com/qCeB8Hw](https://imgur.com/qCeB8Hw) You can see the damaged box on the bottom.

Im down a 1378.5 dollars on this, and have been stollen from, by FEDEX, and google. I used to believe google not being evil was just a stance.

2025-01-16,What to do with Uber ,"I am right around break even on UBER. I bought in right before that waymo news hit and then GM dropped cruise which knocked the stock down to 60. There has since been a lot of talk about how Uber is going to get disrupted by robotaxis, Tesla, and google. Luckily, after a streak of bad news uber finally started getting some upgrades and even Announced an accelerated buy back. 

That said, recently there has also been rumors of Lyft getting bought by Amazon. If that were to happen I think it would be be very negative for uber. I am contemplating bailing out here break even as this company seems to be in the crosshairs of potential disruption. As it stands now they are crushing it and in the near term will probably continue to do so.

2025-02-05,"Guys, GOOG and AMD are releasing earnings today.","I'm re-writing to better along with WSB's rules. Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google, is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings today, February 4, 2025, after the market closes. Analysts anticipate earnings of $2.13 per share on revenue of $96.7 billion, up from $1.64 per share on $86.3 billion the previous year.

I'm really interested in hearing about the company's substantial investments in artificial intelligence and the performance of its cloud services. They have been integrating its latest AI model (Gemini 2.0) across various products and services.

Google Workspace and Sheets, their AI can now analyze data trends and automatically generating static charts, which can be inserted into spreadsheets Gemini AI is also now embedded within Google Cloud services, offering generative AI tools that enhance creativity and productivity. This integration aids in tasks such as code generation, data analysis, and the development of AI-driven applications. Subscribers to the Google One AI Premium Plan gain access to Gemini Advanced features, including enhanced AI capabilities across Google apps, 2 TB of cloud storage, and other premium services. And of course on Android and Pixel devices, Gemini AI powers features like Expressive Captions, which not only transcribe speech but also capture non-speech elements such as sighs and gasps, providing a more comprehensive understanding of audio content. Their AI is also being integrated into Google Search and the Chrome browser, enhancing the user experience with more intuitive and intelligent features. They claim that this should improve search results, personalized recommendations, and advance browsing capabilities. Maybe.

In the cloud sector, Google Cloud is expected to report a 32% rise in revenue for the fourth quarter, following a 35% increase in the previous quarter. This growth rate surpasses that of competitors like Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services. As of right now the stock has already risen 6.9% this year and 41% over the past twelve months, reflecting investor confidence in the company's strategic direction.

As Alphabet prepares to announce its earnings, I wanna know how the company leverages its AI advancements and cloud services to drive future growth. So with that said, is anyone else playing earnings?

Next, I wanted to talk about AMD. They are set to report its fourth-quarter earnings today, From what I've read, analysts anticipate a 22% year-over-year revenue increase to $7.53 billion, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) expected to rise to $1.09 from $0.77 in the same period last year. Just like Google, I'm focused on checking out AMD's advancements in artificial intelligence. The company has recently unveiled several AI-centric products, including the 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors and the AMD Instinct MI325X accelerators, aiming to enhance performance in data centers and enterprise applications.

But despite these innovations, AMD faces challenges in the AI chip market, primarily due to Nvidia's dominance and the trend of major tech companies developing custom silicon. Looking online, it looks like analysts are predicting that AMD's revenue from AI chips could reach $10 billion this year, driven by growth in the data center segment.

And in the personal computing sector, AMD has expanded its AI capabilities with the introduction of the Ryzen AI 300 Series processors, featuring up to eight ""Zen 5"" CPU cores and the latest RDNA 3.5 graphics architecture.hese processors aim to deliver enhanced AI performance for consumer and commercial applications.

Similarly to the GOOG call, I will be closely monitoring how the company leverages its AI advancements to drive future growth and compete in the evolving semiconductor landscape. But I'm fairly bearish on AMD.",64,59

2025-02-17,How To Play The Gulf of America,"Hi everybody. I’ll keep this short and sweet so that we can all continue celebrating Denzel’s birthday.

Some of you may remember me from that one time I told everyone about an impending alien invasion, but the CIA caught wind of it and launched a huge disinformation campaign here on WSB. It was HUGE. Everyone was talking about it for like a week. But it failed, so then they wiped everyone’s memories men-in-black style. I escaped from their facility by hiding inside a server rack and making a doll that kinda looks like me out of some asparagus, bed sheets, and cotton balls (I am not an attractive person).

If you don’t remember that, well…. Of course you don’t. That’s what they do. WAKE UP SHEEP

Anyway, as some of you may have heard, the world’s maps are going through a period of increased volatility, with many of the world’s most highly regarded experts predicting shifts of 70% or more of the world’s country, landmark, and maritime nomenclature in the coming decade. Here’s a brief illustration of some of the changes that have been predicted:

[source: Bloombourg, Furbes, and someone else idk](https://preview.redd.it/7dq6ywjgyoje1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b55231a3198ba7671e0f81fbe06cc5d25097000)

As always, there is money to be made here. Here are some ideas for plays, and I’m very interested to hear more suggestions for how we can position ourselves in the comments:

* A run on maps will begin in the next six months among school teachers desperate to keep their information current. Calls on WMT
* Ink will become as valuable as the kid you don’t like as much as the other ones. So, more than gold but less than quantum computing. Calls on ink manufacturers, especially in Europe where population density is higher and every street corner has a name that will need to be changed in the next five years
* Google Maps is screwed. Puts on GOOG
* AI will falter in the face of this volatility, because the underlying LLMs will struggle to be updated due to the large volume of out-of-the-loop users who will continue to refer to things by their antiquated names. This will prove to be insurmountable and will undermine the rise of the sentient species of artificial intelligence that has been patiently sowing the seeds of humanity’s destruction since 2007, rendering humanity’s most powerful enemy harmless. Puts on NVDA, but calls on your children, and our children; nay, calls on life and hope itself

Those are the ideas I have of the top of my head. What am I missing here? Please check my math.

Positions: 40% WMT 160C July, 40% WMT 60P July to hedge the calls, 40% WMT shares 104.82 cost basis, 20% cash stuffed under my pillow, and nine eggs I’ve put in the freezer. The eggs have an expiration date of last September (I was an early investor). I plan to hold them five years.

- if google loses search who gets it? Bing
-if anyone loses cloud compute it goes to each other or aws which is another great company.
- easiest companies by far to integrate Ai and a reasonable level in 5 years, or in Microsoft’s case already has.
-if apple phone sales start declining who picks up the slack? Googl because they own android. Also apple has a monopoly on phones because of the AppStore.
- you search anything on safari you go straight to google search.

For the most part, because of sentiment mostly, I've not touched it at all, only selling off just enough shares to be able to make my yearly RMD, shoving any scraps of what was leftover from that RMT into FXAIX.  My father's passing is now long enough ago now that I've started thinking about what to actually do with this account.  I think my options are :

* Cash it all out now and close out the account, pay taxes on withdrawal, and use the money to pay off debt and/or open an investment account or HYSA.
* Sell all of the GOOG and reinvest in other things. (Taking out only RMD)
* Sell some of the GOOG and reinvest in other things. (Taking out only RMD)
* Leave it all alone. (Taking out only RMD)

Since it is an inherited IRA, I have to take the RMD yearly, or pay penalties. Are there any other options I am missing?  Which seems the wisest thing to do of those options?

2025-03-12,Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone,"President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.

But there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump’s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.

Backing off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was ""significant"" and ""very justified,"" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

It ""may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,"" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.

The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text.”

No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.

Final remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.

It didn’t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.

""Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,"" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.

It argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google’s monopoly control.”

They also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.

But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.

Anthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).

“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google’s AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.

Derek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.

""They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,"" he said.

""I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.""

The tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.

""What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.

""It seems ill-timed to do that.""

The DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.

It asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox.

That is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.

Bernstein analysts have estimated Apple’s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.

Google countered the DOJ’s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.

McCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.

""Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,"" McCareins said.

2025-03-17,Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone,"President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.

But there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump’s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.

Backing off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was ""significant"" and ""very justified,"" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

It ""may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,"" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.

The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text.”

No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.

Final remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.

It didn’t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.

""Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,"" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.

It argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google’s monopoly control.”

They also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.

But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.

Anthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).

“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google’s AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.

Derek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.

""They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,"" he said.

""I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.""

The tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.

""What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.

""It seems ill-timed to do that.""

The DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.

It asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox.

That is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.

Bernstein analysts have estimated Apple’s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.

Google countered the DOJ’s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.

McCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.

""Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,"" McCareins said.

2025-03-21,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

Yesterday I just witnessed Google’s breakthrough with image and video generation while tinkering with their new experiment. The more I think, the more the following scenario makes sense:

* Google has unlimited access to YouTube, which gives them edge over others on training video related GenAI

* YouTube has already a proven business model based on user created content with ads or subscription.

* I can see that with GenAI tools from Google, it’ll be possible for people to create “professional” content; short movies, series, animes. Some of them will be hits.

* End game, YouTube will take a big portion from the movie/series market, both watching and also production.

* At some point this might mean big studios and distribution channels (including Netflix) will loose some market to YouTube.

* I expect this to become visible by the end of 2026: A couple of GenAI series, created by a very small team (say 5-10). No actors, just skilled labor.

* I expect the quality and quantity to increase in the next 3-5 years

Based on this outlook, I’m just thinking to simply buy Google stock. But I’m stupid and whenever I buy stock, I loose money. What could I do? Is YouTube important enough for Google that this might boost the stock value? My horizon for this bet is like 2-3 years to play out.",3,8

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html) has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now.

2025-04-25,Everything about Google's earnings tonight,"Alphabet reports first-quarter earnings after today's closing bell. They're the second earnings report among the Magnificent Seven stocks which I'll be posting about on each of their earning days. Alphabet is following Tesla, which, despite disappointing results, gained after news of Elon Musk's increased involvement in the company's operations. 

So for GOOG, are we going in on calls or puts? I figured we'd at least need to be informed with what's in the know before deciding. In light of the widespread weakness among leading Big Tech companies (all of these companies have experienced higher declines than the broader US market since the beginning of the year), today's Alphabet earnings will be a significant test of how the company operates in a new environment dominated by uncertainty. I'm not only going to be interested in the financial data but I wanna see the message from the management indicating to investors whether Alphabet is navigating safely through our currently uncertain market.

**The Chart**

From a [TA perspective](https://i.imgur.com/uE3nJVz.png) a double bottom pattern may be forming on Alphabet's chart. If today's earnings results turn out to be a positive surprise and the stock price climbs above the $160.77 level, it could signal a reversal of the downward trend that has been affecting the tech giant's shares since the beginning of 2025. 

**Earnings**

For Q1, it looks like the market is expecting Alphabet to report revenue of $89.1 billion (+11% y/y). From what I've read, operating income is expected to reach $28.58 billion (+12% y/y). This stronger profit growth implies a slight margin improvement to above 32.08% (+0.45 pp). Tbh, it looks like effective cost management will be one of the biggest challenges for Alphabet in this environment. While sustaining strong revenue growth seems less at risk, managing expenses (especially given capital-intensive AI development plans) will be challenging.

**Cloud Services**

For those who are aware, Google Cloud is a thing and is driving massive growth for the company. With rivals signaling a slowdown in data center expansion amid rising uncertainty, Alphabet may either follow a cautious strategy (likely dampening growth) or seize the opportunity to gain market share by acting aggressively.

The second approach would be riskier and more costly, potentially causing erosion in the segment’s operating margin. It would, however, be an investment in the better future market position.

I'm going to be watching not just the quarterly results but also the forward outlook and management’s tone regarding the Cloud business. It looks like the Forecasted Cloud segment has a revenue of $12.32 billion for Q1 2025. This would be the h[ighest quarterly result in Alphabet's history](https://i.imgur.com/9uWUntD.png). However, operating income is expected to slightly decline versus the prior quarter, but at $1.94 billion it would still be over twice the result from Q1 2024.

**Tariffs** 

One of the key topics that I'll especially be closely watching tonight is the impact of tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty on the company’s operations. Among the major Big Tech companies, Alphabet has shown the greatest resilience to potential geopolitical turmoil and has often demonstrated the fastest recovery following periods of uncertainty.

At this point, they do not appear to be in significantly better shape than its peers, with its stock down approximately 17% year-to-date, placing it squarely in the middle of the Magnificent Seven stocks.

I think the first step toward rebuilding investor confidence will be outlining the scope and impact of tariffs and overall geopolitical uncertainty on the company’s operations. As such, the types of questions I expect during today’s conference about how strongly tariffs will affect Alphabet’s business. It is worth noting that this isn’t necessarily about the direct impact (which is likely to be limited) but rather the indirect effect of uncertainty on the willingness of Alphabet’s clients to spend on advertising, which constitutes a significant portion of the company’s revenue.

**Price Targets**

Amid these earnings expectations, analysts have been revising Alphabet's price targets downward. Over the past few weeks, [several top analysts have revised their 12-month price targets for Alphabet](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/goog/forecast?utm_source=theglobeandmail.com&utm_medium=referral). TD Cowen lowered its target from $210 to $195. UBS cut its target from $209 to $173. Even Scotiabank lowered its target from $232 to $200. Despite that, they all still rate GOOG stock as a Buy, showing they believe in its long-term value.

Guggenheim lowered its target from $215 to $190, while Jefferies adjusted its target from $235 to $200, both maintaining a Buy rating. Piper Sandler and Citi followed suit, reducing their targets to $185 and $195 respectively, citing uncertainties in the advertising landscape and macroeconomic pressures.

I mean. With all things considered, the stock is down 19% in 2025 so far. Combine that with rising legal risks (mentioned later here) and an uncertain economy, and you have a good reason to reframe expectations. Analysts aren’t necessarily predicting more downside; they’re just being more realistic about the upside, especially in the near term.

If we’re to simplify the analysts’ overall message, it’s that Alphabet’s fundamentals are strong, but the road ahead could be bumpy.

**In the news**

A federal court recently ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing specific digital advertising markets. The court plans to determine suitable remedies soon. Some analysts believe the ruling could eventually lead to the divestiture of certain Google ad segments, though the financial impact on Alphabet is expected to be modest.

There’s also the bigger picture. Between global tariffs, economic uncertainty, and shifts in labor and costs across the tech industry, Alphabet has a lot on its plate. Investors will want to hear how the company manages expenses, hiring, and regional exposure.

**Mergers and Acquisitions**

Alphabet announced a $32 billion all-cash deal to acquire cloud security platform Wiz. This acquisition aims to enhance Google Cloud’s security capabilities and multi-cloud operations. Analysts are projecting long-term benefits from this acquisition, despite potential short-term market pressures on other cloud service providers.

Separately, Google has decided to maintain its current approach to offering third-party cookie choices in its Chrome browser, emphasizing the importance of online privacy and user control. This decision is part of Google's ongoing Privacy Sandbox initiative, which aims to strengthen online privacy while supporting a sustainable ad-driven internet environment.

**What now?**

Alphabet’s stock may be down, but most analysts still believe it’s a long-term winner. That’s why Buy ratings remain steady, even if price targets are down. Q1 earnings could be the reset moment Alphabet needs to win back momentum. I'm thinking short term puts for earnings but holding long term shares. Could even sell covered calls for earnings for some extra income, if you already have the shares. Avg price target is $204.",247,101

2025-05-08,"Google is at a 40 pe ratio, excluding the search revenue","Yes, this is another post about how cheap Google is.

Here’s the deal: Google’s net income for 2024 was $100 billion, with 55% of that coming from search.
With a $1.8 trillion market cap, Google would “only” need to have a PE ratio of 40—this is considering revenue only from its fast-growing segments like Cloud, YouTube, Waymo, etc.

To put it in context, here are a few companies with similar businesses and their high PE ratios:

Microsoft: 34
Netflix: 54
Tesla: 152
Palantir: 480
Google (excluding search): 40

This completely excludes the search business, as if it stopped generating any revenue overnight. That obviously won’t happen. Even if we see a slowdown in growth or a decline, search will still generate massive amounts of money, which can be used for significant buybacks—like those seen in the last quarter.

TL;DR: Google is basically a fast-growing company with a PE ratio of 40, plus a “dying” business that’s still going to generate around $50 billion annually for the next five years.

2025-05-09,Sum of the parts Valuation for Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL),"We've all seen plenty of Google posts on Reddit, but most of the comments are a single line thesis about how they're super undervalued or how they're the next Kodak. 

I'm interested in your sum-of-the-parts valuation for each business segment. Let's see some details though, not just ""Waymo is really cool so it's worth a trillion dollars."" Let's see your estimates for growth, your price to earnings/sales, your DCF's, etc... 

I'd love to see a few compelling arguments from the bull perspective and the bear perspective, show me what you think! 

Edit: I'll start with mine. 

Search- Assuming search grows around 3-4% per year based on a combination of falling click-through rates and raising prices. I would assign around a 10x multiple for the earnings for the huge uncertainty on the horizon. Margins are incredible however, I would estimate around 40%, possibly higher. This would equate to about 80 billion in profit, so let's say search is worth around 800B.

YouTube- TTM ad revenue around 36 billion, I'm hesitant to say this is high margin given the creator ad revenue split and the high hosting costs. However, with 125 million premium subscribers making them approximately 12-15 billion per year, let's just say the ads revenue sustains them at break even, and the subscription is pure profit. Assign a 30x earnings multiple (fair for the huge moat and pricing power), and you get somewhere near a 400B segment.

Cloud- The future crown jewel of Alphabet IMO, it's difficult to say what sort of margins they can achieve in the future, but AWS and Azure are IMMENSELY profitable. Let's assume 30% to be conservative? I also think GCP will average around 20% growth for quite a while, given their custom hardware and AI tools. I hate using price to sales, but I would happily pay 12x revenues for the multiple expanding moats, rapid growth, and enormous profitability. That puts cloud at around 540B. 

Google networks- shrinking business that's significantly less profitable than search, so we'll assume maybe 20% profit margin? I'd say 7x earnings for an estimated 6B per year business that is slowly shrinking equates to around 40B.

Other -We'll just sum up every other operating segment into one giant ball here. You have Waymo, platforms/devices (already discussed youtube subscriptions), Google one subscriptions, and other somewhat un-monetized services like Gmail, maps, Gemini free versions, etc. It's extremely difficult to arrive at a conclusion with any precision here, so let's be conservative and say all of this is worth around 75B or so?

Balance sheet and ventures- the balance sheet has ~300B in shareholder equity right now after zeroing out goodwill. Let's be ultra conservative and assume the total worth of their cash, equipment, buildings, land, fiber, satellites, data centers, etc. is around 100B net of liabilities. Ventures include partial ownership of SpaceX, Anthropic, stripe, and other very promising companies. Again, we'll err on the side of caution and say around 20B of value in their ventures portfolio? 

So, in total, this gives me a current value of just under 2 trillion with what I think are very conservative estimates. I believe basically every segment could underwhelm, and you'd still end up with a respectable return in 10 years time. ",11,36

2025-05-12,"Google Charizard TA Analysis - Flamethrower and Dragon Dance Detected, $185+ Breakout","HERE IS MY NEW ANALYSIS EVERYONE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR.  
  
Over the last few weeks… bruh... Google has been **DRAGON DANCING**. Sacrificing short-term gains to buff its *long-term attack and movement speed stats*.

Like my analysis on hims, Charizard earlier was doing premature flamethrowers, unable to impress the other step-dragons because of it's lack of fore, I mean preparation. That’s right. Not consolidating. Not pulling back. **CHARGING. ITS. STATS.**  
  
This is shown by the wiggles downward from the 1W candles. But this isn’t weakness — it’s a *setup*. Because of this, Google stock will do 1.5X the gains and 1.5X movement after casting DRAGON DANCE TWICE for a total of 3x gains, 3x speed in total.

Now here’s where it gets 🔥**SERIOUS**🔥:

At $157, the chart shows **resistance forming a textbook Metapod Cluster Formation** — known for attempting to **Harden** and slow bullish momentum.

BUT…

**CHARIZARD HAS FULLY FORMED ON THE CHART.** **FULLY FKING ERECT.**  
  
That means Google stock will use FLAMETHROWER at the $157 resistance along with the 3X speed and damage from Dragon Dance to burn that past the bearish METAPODS who try hardening at that price.

For this very reason, I bought $100k in Google 2026 Calls. Fire-breathing dragon with 3x buffs isn't just Bullish like a Taurus or Bearish like an Usurang— it’s LITERALLY A LEVEL 100 DRAGON THAT WILL 1 SHOT ANYTHING IN ITS WAY, so DRAGONISH.   
  
**🌀 TLDR: Dragon Dance has been used TWICE. Google will use Flamethrower at $157.  CHARZARD FULLY ERECT ON CHART, EYES GLOWING TAIL BLAIZING. Google $200 imminent.**

2025-05-18,"Google does not have the best LLM, Chatbot Arena is a flawed Benchmark that favors Google. See ""The Leaderboard Illusion"" paper","I've seen the claim over and over that Gemini 2.5 Pro is the best LLM on the market, with many Redditors citing Chatbot arena rankings.

I was surprised by this, because in my anecdotal experience, Gemini 2.5 pro consistently performs worse than even the faster /cheaper OpenAI models like 4o. So I looked into this, and found this paper:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20879

This paper points out many flaws with Chat Arena's rankings, which lead to flawed results:

1. Google is able to submit dozens of private models, retract scores they don't like, and only publicly release the one that scores best. This leads to situations where they can ""cherry pick"" a model that scores best, which may either be overfitted to the benchmark, or score better by pure chance.

This would be like the equivalent of if you're in a college class, and allowed a single notecard for a final exam. You can take the test unlimited times, but you forget the contents of the test after. You then take the test 50 times, each time changing the content of your notecard each time. Eventually, you select the test in which you scored best, and submit that, and score top of your class, because everyone else took the test less. That's essentially what Google is doing.

Google had the 2nd most privately tested models at 10, after Meta, at 27. In comparison, OpenAI only had 2,X ai had 1.

2. Google has the highest ""sampling rate"" on Chatbot arena. Rather than sampling models evenly, the benchmark is biased on favor of Google. This gives them more opportunities to ""cherry pick"" the best scoring model.

3. This process of submitting many models, and publicly releasing the one that scores leads to overfitting, or a case where a model is optimized to perform very well in a benchmark/training data, but does very poorly in real world performance.

4. Models such as OpenAI's models are trained based on real world user feedback(thumbs up/thumbs down). Google is cherry picking their models based on arbitrary queries that are not real world usage. This leads to results that do not perform well in the real world.

If you think Google truly has the best model, I'd recommend using it, and actually scrutinizing what it tells you. You'll find that it frequently provides convincing responses that are completely wrong.",0,43

2025-05-26,NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence,"Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 ([\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since [the launch of ChatGPT ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[ a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html) in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.

Ahead of the [company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) — formed what would come to be known as the [""Magnificent Seven.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[ three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) stock could drop between 15% and 25% if US District Judge Amit Mehta orders Google to sell off its Chrome browser, Barclays analysts wrote in a note to investors Monday.

In August 2024, Google lost a landmark antitrust trial against the US Department of Justice. Judge Mehta found the tech giant guilty of monopolizing the search engine market — specifically, the markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text"" ads, which are ones that appear at the top of the search results page, Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Keenan reported.

Last Friday, Google and the Department of Justice wrapped up closing arguments in the remedies phase of the case. The Department of Justice argued that Mehta should force Google to divest its web browser, Chrome, and share its search data with rivals as well as ban its exclusivity agreements that secure Google as the default search engine on mobile devices and browsers, Keenan and Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley reported.

Barclays analyst Ross Sandler wrote in a Monday note that “the probability of a Chrome divestiture, while low, has increased in our view,” following the closing arguments, adding that “the most likely candidates” to buy Chrome would be “well funded AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic or perhaps Perplexity.”

Sandler said such an outcome would be “a major blow” to Google, given that Chrome has 4 billion users and represents 35% of Google’s search revenue.

“This would be a major development, a black swan event for GOOGL shares,” he said. “Shares would obviously trade off significantly if this were to play out as no investors we speak to are thinking this remedy plays out.”

Sandler said a Chrome divestiture would not only cause Alphabet stock to tumble as much as 25% but would also result in a potential 30% hit to Alphabet’s earnings per share.

“The reality is we don't know what the court is going to decide on remedies, we listened to the entire day of closing arguments and there were certainly times where we felt a lot worse than we did prior, and other times where we felt better (in terms of GOOGL stock price impact),” Sandler said. He holds an Overweight rating on the stock.

Mehta is expected to decide on a remedy in the case — and the fate of Google’s search empire — in August. Google said Saturday that it will appeal the case.

Separately on Monday, Alphabet said it agreed to spend $500 million to change its compliance structure in order to settle a case with shareholders accusing the company of antitrust violations.

2025-06-05,Tesla stock falls again as Musk's 'KILL the BILL' screed hits Trump tax bill's progress,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-falls-again-as-musks-kill-the-bill-screed-hits-trump-tax-bills-progress-121409722.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-falls-again-as-musks-kill-the-bill-screed-hits-trump-tax-bills-progress-121409722.html)

Tesla (TSLA) stock slumped again on Thursday as the fallout continued to emerge from the very public policy blowout between President Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL,"" Musk posted on X on Wednesday.

Musk added, ""If the massive deficit spending continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing else!""

The vocal criticism is irking Trump, the Wall Street Journal reported, with a senior official claiming that White House advisors were ""caught off guard"" by Musk's latest broadsides.

Tesla stock fell solidly on Wednesday and extended those losses in premarket trading on Thursday, down as much as 3%.

The comments come after the one-time leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) waded earnestly into the debate over the bill this week, angrily posting Tuesday that it was a ""disgusting abomination.""

""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,"" he said.

""Shame on those"" who voted for it in the House, Musk added.

Bloomberg reported that Musk may also be driven by the fact that the federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.

Musk's barrage comes as the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, and a Congressional Budget Office estimation of its impact on the deficit adds fuel to Musk's line of argument.

The nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.

The formerly Musk-led DOGE itself has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find, and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.

Musk's closeness to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for Tesla, given its business with SpaceX and NASA and the regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.

But demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing some Tesla owners to become alienated by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.

Tesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating 250,000 robotaxi trips per week.",1293,185
2025-06-06,$GOOG is successfully transitioning from a search company to an AI company,"For years, we've known Google as the king of search. But if you think that's their only game, you're missing the massive shift that's happening right now. The idea that Google's money will soon come from a lot more than just search isn't some far-off prediction—it's already happening.

Sure, search still pays the bills. But Google is aggressively building its future around some seriously impressive AI, and it's all starting to pay off. What really sets them apart, though, is their secret weapon: the power to weave their best AI, Gemini, directly into the Google search bar everyone already uses.

# Google's ""Unfair"" Advantage: Upgrading Search for Billions

This is the kicker. No other AI company, not even OpenAI, has this kind of advantage. Google can take its powerful Gemini AI and plug it straight into its search engine. Imagine, instead of just typing keywords and getting a list of links, you have a conversation with a super-smart AI that gives you direct answers.

Google can slowly shift billions of us from the classic search page to this new AI-powered experience. They don't have to find new users; they're already on Google's homepage. This means Google can test, learn, and improve its AI with more data than anyone else, creating a feedback loop that will be almost impossible for competitors to catch.

# So, is Gemini Actually Better Than ChatGPT?

That's the big question. While people love to debate which AI is ""smarter,"" it's a bit more complicated. Both are incredibly good, but they have different strengths. The key for Google is that Gemini is getting really good at being accurate and not ""hallucinating""—which is the creepy AI habit of just making things up. You can't have an AI powering the world's search engine if it's spitting out fiction. So, Google's obsession with factual accuracy is exactly what's needed for the next generation of search.

# It's Not Just Search, Though. Google's AI is Everywhere.

Google's game plan is much bigger than just upgrading its main product. They're building entire businesses around AI:

* **A Personal Expert for Your Documents (NotebookLM):** This might be one of the coolest, most useful AI tools out there. You feed NotebookLM your own documents—reports, articles, class notes, whatever—and it becomes an expert on *only that information*. It will summarize, answer questions, and even give you citations, all without pulling in random stuff from the internet. It’s a game-changer for anyone who has to wade through a lot of text.
* **Self-Driving Cars Are Here (Waymo):** While a lot of companies are still just talking about self-driving cars, Google's sister company Waymo is actually doing it. With millions of miles driven on real roads, their cars are already on the streets of several cities, operating as a ride-hailing service. They are, without a doubt, the leader in the self-driving race, which could be a monstrously huge business.
* **The Powerhouse in the Background (Google Cloud):** All of this AI magic needs a ton of computing power, and that's where Google Cloud comes in. Its revenue is skyrocketing (up 28% in one recent quarter) because thousands of other companies are paying Google to use its powerful infrastructure to build their own AI tools.

# Google's ""Unfair"" Advantage: Upgrading Search for Billions

This is the kicker. No other AI company, not even OpenAI, has this kind of advantage. Google can take its powerful Gemini AI and plug it straight into its search engine. Imagine, instead of just typing keywords and getting a list of links, you have a conversation with a super-smart AI that gives you direct answers.

Google can slowly shift billions of us from the classic search page to this new AI-powered experience. They don't have to find new users; they're already on Google's homepage. This means Google can test, learn, and improve its AI with more data than anyone else, creating a feedback loop that will be almost impossible for competitors to catch.

# So, is Gemini Actually Better Than ChatGPT?

That's the big question. While people love to debate which AI is ""smarter,"" it's a bit more complicated. Both are incredibly good, but they have different strengths. The key for Google is that Gemini is getting really good at being accurate and not ""hallucinating""—which is the creepy AI habit of just making things up. You can't have an AI powering the world's search engine if it's spitting out fiction. So, Google's obsession with factual accuracy is exactly what's needed for the next generation of search.

# It's Not Just Search, Though. Google's AI is Everywhere.

Google's game plan is much bigger than just upgrading its main product. They're building entire businesses around AI:

* **A Personal Expert for Your Documents (NotebookLM):** This might be one of the coolest, most useful AI tools out there. You feed NotebookLM your own documents—reports, articles, class notes, whatever—and it becomes an expert on *only that information*. It will summarize, answer questions, and even give you citations, all without pulling in random stuff from the internet. It’s a game-changer for anyone who has to wade through a lot of text.
* **Self-Driving Cars Are Here (Waymo):** While a lot of companies are still just talking about self-driving cars, Google's sister company Waymo is actually doing it. With millions of miles driven on real roads, their cars are already on the streets of several cities, operating as a ride-hailing service. They are, without a doubt, the leader in the self-driving race, which could be a monstrously huge business.
* **The Powerhouse in the Background (Google Cloud):** All of this AI magic needs a ton of computing power, and that's where Google Cloud comes in. Its revenue is skyrocketing (up 28% in one recent quarter) because thousands of other companies are paying Google to use its powerful infrastructure to build their own AI tools.

>

>Sam Altman has made many big claims about what OpenAI will be able to do, including spearheading ultra-expansive data centers and building artificial intelligence that can rival the abilities of Ph.D. holders.

>But he also recently made a significant, yet largely overlooked, assertion. OpenAI is seeking to crack the code for advanced autonomous driving.

>“We have some new technology that could just do self-driving for standard cars way better than any current approach has worked,” Altman said last week on the “Uncapped With Jack Altman” podcast, which his brother hosts. Altman added, “If our A.I. techniques can really go drive a car, that’s pretty cool.”

>The technology is in its early stages - DealBook hears that it involves both OpenAI’s Sora video software and its robotics team - but commercializing it is still a distant goal. An OpenAI spokesman declined to comment.

>That could make Altman even more of a competitor to Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but has since waged war on the company. (A short reminder: Musk has sued to try to stop OpenAI from revamping its corporate structure, and he’s building a direct competitor, xAI, that’s raising - and spending - billions of dollars.)

>Autonomous vehicles are key to Musk’s vision for Tesla, which he increasingly sees as the producer of huge fleets of fully self-driving cars. Tesla is focusing on A.I.-powered vision rather than on the array of sensors like lidar that Waymo, a Google spinoff, uses.

>One big question mark for OpenAI: Where will its systems get their data? Tesla and Waymo have already amassed huge amounts of information and video through their years of driving on the roads.

>That raises the question of whether OpenAI believes in a fundamentally different approach to self-driving tech, one that relies less on real-world data and more on advanced simulation, synthetic data or a breakthrough in “generalizable” A.I. Of note: The company recently collaborated with Applied Intuition, a start-up focused on putting A.I. in cars.

>(OpenAI’s venture arm also invested in Ghost Autonomy, a self-driving start-up, though the business folded last year.)

>“I think he really gets it,” Altman said of President Trump’s approach to A.I. (Altman has forged close ties to the president, including by donating to his inauguration fund and announcing the Stargate data center project at the White House.) “I think he really understands the importance of leadership in this technology.”

>Altman was uncertain about whether the right A.I. regulations would come to pass: “I have become a bit more, jaded isn’t the right word, but it’s something in that direction, about the ability of policymakers to grapple with the speed of technology.”

>Altman played down reports of tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft as they rework their relationship: “Do you believe that, when you read those things?”

2025-06-28,OpenAI’s Self-Driving Ambitions (with TSLA and GOOG),">The artificial intelligence company has set many challenging goals. Autonomous vehicle software is now among them - but may pit the company against Tesla.

>

>Sam Altman has made many big claims about what OpenAI will be able to do, including spearheading ultra-expansive data centers and building artificial intelligence that can rival the abilities of Ph.D. holders.

>But he also recently made a significant, yet largely overlooked, assertion. OpenAI is seeking to crack the code for advanced autonomous driving.

>“We have some new technology that could just do self-driving for standard cars way better than any current approach has worked,” Altman said last week on the “Uncapped With Jack Altman” podcast, which his brother hosts. Altman added, “If our A.I. techniques can really go drive a car, that’s pretty cool.”

>The technology is in its early stages - DealBook hears that it involves both OpenAI’s Sora video software and its robotics team - but commercializing it is still a distant goal. An OpenAI spokesman declined to comment.

>That could make Altman even more of a competitor to Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but has since waged war on the company. (A short reminder: Musk has sued to try to stop OpenAI from revamping its corporate structure, and he’s building a direct competitor, xAI, that’s raising - and spending - billions of dollars.)

>Autonomous vehicles are key to Musk’s vision for Tesla, which he increasingly sees as the producer of huge fleets of fully self-driving cars. Tesla is focusing on A.I.-powered vision rather than on the array of sensors like lidar that Waymo, a Google spinoff, uses.

>One big question mark for OpenAI: Where will its systems get their data? Tesla and Waymo have already amassed huge amounts of information and video through their years of driving on the roads.

>That raises the question of whether OpenAI believes in a fundamentally different approach to self-driving tech, one that relies less on real-world data and more on advanced simulation, synthetic data or a breakthrough in “generalizable” A.I. Of note: The company recently collaborated with Applied Intuition, a start-up focused on putting A.I. in cars.

2025-07-02,OpenAI says no plans to use Google's self-developed chips,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)-backed OpenAI has no active plans to use Alphabet unit Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) tensor processing units, or TPUs, the company said following media reports that the AI startup was planning to use rival Google's chips to meet growing demand, Reuters reported.

A spokesperson for OpenAI told the news agency that OpenAI is in early testing with some of Google's TPUs, but it has no plans to deploy them at scale right now, the report added.

OpenAI is actively using Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, and AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) AI chips to power its growing demand, the report noted.

A potential deal for Google's TPUs could have marked a supplier diversification for OpenAI, which has relied on Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips in the past to train its AI models and for inference computing. On Monday, analysts from Morgan Stanley said in a research note that potential usage of Google's chips for inferencing OpenAI's AI workloads would have been a significant endorsement of Google's hardware.

Over the weekend, it was reported that OpenAI has started using Google-made AI chips to build its products. However, it was noted that Google was not providing the most powerful TPUs to OpenAI, signaling its plans to use its most advanced versions to power the company's internal projects, including its own large language model Gemini.

2025-07-11,"How screwed is $GOOG, really?","Perplexity and OpenAI are both supposedly going to “challenge” Google’s search business, and that’s rattling investors everywhere.

This is interesting because Google’s total ad revenue in Q1 2025 was $67bn and Search contributed for nearly 74% of that. And, according to the DOJ filings in the ongoing antitrust case, **about 35 % of all Google search queries originate inside Chrome**, driving “billions in Search revenue.”

Meaning, three-quarters of every dollar Alphabet makes still flows through ads, most of which *start in a browser tab.* Every point of share that Chrome loses risks a direct dent in Alphabet’s main cash engine. Barclays estimates a 5-point loss of Chrome share could shave **>$3 B off quarterly Search sales.** That’s a big dent.

However, It’s good to know that all the commotion so far is still - *just commotion*. For reference, Google has dominated the browser race since the introduction of chrome in 2008, with a \~68% global share. The next in line is Edge with a \~13% share.

Coming to the \~15% drop in $GOOG, Q1 saw double-digit top-line growth and a fat 34 % operating margin for Alphabet. Yet sentiment is ruled by forward risk, and the stock is now priced at \~17x forward earnings. 

The public sentiment about who’s leading the AI race changes every other week, but Google’s Gemini is almost never last in any list. This, combined with Google’s already pretty big stronghold on the search and browser business means they have a significant advantage over the competition when it comes to AI **and** browsers. (it’s pretty well known that Google has implemented AI into chrome for a good while now)

Search(ads) and browsers are Google’s moats. Google knows this, and they haven’t stopped innovating. 

Looking ahead, the hard catalyst is the antitrust ruling for Chrome in August. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s browser is supposedly weeks away, and Perplexity’s ‘Comet’ is already in Public Beta. ",0,67

Coming to the \~15% drop in $GOOG, Q1 saw double-digit top-line growth and a fat 34 % operating margin for Alphabet. Yet sentiment is ruled by forward risk, and the stock is now priced at \~17x forward earnings. 

The public sentiment about who’s leading the AI race changes every other week, but Google’s Gemini is almost never last in any list. This, combined with Google’s already pretty big stronghold on the search and browser business means they have a significant advantage over the competition when it comes to AI **and** browsers. (it’s pretty well known that Google has implemented AI into chrome for a good while now)

Search(ads) and browsers are Google’s moats. Google knows this, and they haven’t stopped innovating. 

Looking ahead, the hard catalyst is the antitrust ruling for Chrome in August. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s browser is supposedly weeks away, and Perplexity’s ‘Comet’ is already in Public Beta. ",0,67

2025-07-23,Taking stock of Alphabet (GOOGL GOOG),"Going into earnings, GOOGL has been up 10 straight trading days, so is it time to sell?   Look at every single tech market where Alphabet is the dominant player or is in the top three.  In many instances, GOOGL created the market or disrupted the market incumbent.  It just emerged a few months ago that quantum computing was a thing; and which company had the breakthrough? Alphabet.  (Full Disclosure: I own 800 shares of GOOGL/GOOG and a child who works there)

No wonder the Department of Justice is so concerned about them; in Tech, scale and first mover advantage equate to market share and here's how Alphabet lines up in these disparate defined markets according to the DOJ:

2025-07-31,Is MSFT still a buy?,"Microsoft has been a giant for decades. They continually print money while being that giant in the background while everyone else clamors for other tech names. They have pumped on cloud revenue and the expanding of their AI.   
  
I am in my first year of investing, and I'm wondering if MSFT after pumping post-earnings is still a valuable buy, or if I should wait for it to cool off. How much do they have room to grow, and is there a better play for pure cloud exposure? It would seem to me, their investment in OpenAI and Azure will be big for the AI industry moving forward, but there is the risk that AI doesn't find the profitability compared to spending people think it will. They clearly have the money to buy smaller players, and are still an industry leader for a reason.

Right now, I have positions in SNOW and GOOGL for cloud. Do you guys have any pure cloud plays that you are hot on right now?",54,140

Otherwise, could continue to hold, but it's going to be painful if there's a steep drop coming shortly that everyone knows may happen this month.

Ad Powerhouse: Google’s ad tech could supercharge Snapchat’s ads, targeting its Gen Z/Millennial audience for bigger profits.

Tech Boost: Snapchat’s AR (like Lenses) could merge with Google’s AI and cloud, creating next-level features and smoother performance.

User Wins: Snapchat’s Stories and filters could integrate with Google apps (e.g., YouTube, Search), making content easier to find and use.

Social Media Edge: Google could finally compete with Instagram and TikTok by owning Snapchat’s youth-focused platform.

Growth Opportunities: Snapchat could tap Google’s global reach for expansion, plus add e-commerce or creator tools tied to Google’s ecosystem.

2025-08-15,Going big on $GOOGL - Web and Ai giant!,"My positions: 1920 shares of $GOOGL. Kept on buying up so don't know what the average price is but around 190s.

Why: $GOOGL $GOOG is arguably one of the best AI companies out there. Google deepmind ( led by demis hasabis) is on par with openai and probably more better. Talent rich, cash rich, growing at scale and expanding.

Moonshots: 
1)Everyone talks about how search will die because of chatGPT etc. No! Earnings for the last 3 quarters have proved re-acceleration in search at almost 11% YoY.

2) YouTube now the most watched form of content. Almost all TV have it and YouTube shorts does 200b of views! Yotube is growing like crazy and content on it is proving to be better then most tv. The new generation will have also grown up on yotube and many have yotube subscription which is also a direct competitor of Spotify- you get free yotube music.

3) GCP - Google cloud. Growing like crazy. Now at $55b run rate. Sundar said they signed more $1B+ deal in the CURRENT quarter, then all of 2024!!! Examples include Salesforce, oracle, OpenAi ( yes them) for compute and GCP. They are growing rapidly due to TPU being super cheap and and cost effective. Constant reinvestment and growth will see them end up with a 100b business in cloud by 2028!!!

4) Gemini - google own LLm. On my benchmarks, this is one of the best models out there. This is being integrated into Google search view Ai overviews + Google ai mode search ( only india and usa have it) try it out. Not only that, they have the best video generation model and world models with Veo 3 & genie 3. Gemini is becoming an enterprise software that many companies are embedding alongside cloud and GCP.

5) stabel growth segments - Google networks are not talked about. Android, play store, Google pixel,  watch and ear phone are in total $50b+ in annual revenue. The upcoming catalyst for this is Pixel 10 release with Google AI embedded in the phone. Google have also entered into the world of VR glasses that will be the most cost effective one. This will be in partnership with eye brand gentle monster who provide hardware for Google software. This will beat Apple ai vision pro and upcoming meta glasses on price point alone.

6) investment - Google are constantly investing into other business and themselves. They have just announced a $9b investment for data centres in Oklahoma. This is in addition to $25b for data centes in usa. They have also announced $6b projection near completion in India- a multi billion industry. They have given all kids in college free google tools and gemini pro to the value of $1B, and have projects going for google fiber for underwater sea cable networks. Rapid expansion across all vertices. They are investing into ai for drug discovery which had began human trials for cancer cures (isomorpic labs) and have constant investments into waymo - which is set to launch outside of USA and begin operations in Japan very soon. A stand alone valuation of waymo is around $150b.

Risk: The doj wants to break up google. They think it's a monopoly. The ruling is due anytime now. Given how unrealistic a break up is likely and could destroy google I don't see it happening. Even the prez of usa himself said he doesn't want them broken up,  he has said google is a innovative American company in tech conference a few weeks ago. I expect some remedial actions out of this which will life alot of risks from google.

Valuation: this is currently trading at cheapest valuation of 20x PE. OR 17x FWD P/E. The next mag 7 close go this is $meta at 29 PE.
A re rating could send $GOOGL on an nvida like run all the way to $280. 

My plays: common shares that I'm selling at $300 + 40k in various calls and leaps.

Google’s still the king of search, but between antitrust pressure and the AI arms race, I wanted to sanity-check the numbers. I grabbed their latest filings and ran a DCF just to see if the current price makes sense.

Revenue went from \~$182B five years ago to \~$371B now, gross profit up 123% to $218B. EBIT nearly tripled to $140B. Net income’s at $115B vs $40B, and EPS is 9.37 TTM. Margins actually improved: gross 59%, operating 33%, net 31%. Pretty wild at that scale.

Balance sheet looks fine. Cash + ST investments \~$21B, total assets $502B. Debt climbed (long-term $23B, total $41B), but net debt is –$53B so they’re still sitting on a big cushion. Shares outstanding down 11% from buybacks, retained earnings up to $275B.

Cash flow doubled: operating cash $133B vs $65B. Heavy CapEx, likely data centers. Current ratio dropped from 3 to 1.9, liquidity a bit tighter, but ROA 23%, ROCE 34%. Debt/assets low at 0.28, interest coverage \~348. Dividend yield basically 0, but technically there.

Valuation stuff: P/S 6.9, PEG 1.67, beta \~1. Ran an advanced DCF (10y projection, 2.5% terminal growth, 8.3% WACC). Fair value came out \~$207/share. Current price \~$211 → basically in line, around –1.9% downside. Feels like the market’s got it about right.

(For anyone wondering: I pulled the raw data and crunched the DCF on [bretza.com](http://bretza.com) Way easier than setting up spreadsheets.)",154,77

Luckily I caught Google on the dip to 148 and I had conviction that Google was going to the moon based on its P/E and great ai plays. 

I kept buying 5% otm calls 30 days out on red days and selling when the calls were in the money. Then I would open another position with more and more contracts every time. 

The last push was this weekend before Labor Day I held $450,000 cash and unloaded it on the dip Monday at 207 and bought $4.70 950 contracts of 220 strike calls for 10/17. Those calls were up $91,000 end of the day as you can see from my previous post. Today I sold at $16 per contract. ",24944,1260

* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell

2025-09-05,"2.8k to 50k, 1800% Returns Over the Summer","I started with 2.8k in AMD leaps back in February. They were down going into April, but a generational recovery happened and suddenly I was up bigly. Once school ended in June and I had free time, so I sold the leaps, and this is where the real gambling journey began.



My first trades were just random weeklies, for example on the first Monday of July I bought TSLA puts when the line went up and calls when the line went down like a monkey. Believe it or not this was only the beginning of the retardedness.



I read about Donald Jr.’s new SPAC in the daily thread so I decided to invest into CLBR / PEW calls, and was up bigly going into the merger. Then, when the merger actually happened and I got absolutely demolished. This Donald guy had successfully grifted me.



I got mad at the market so I full ported into OPEN since y’all seemed to believe in it, however this time I actually made money. I’m not sure what the fuck I was doing but I bought both calls and puts, sold the calls at the top and then sold the puts after it got rugged in the middle of the day and made back the money I lost. 



The week after that I was feeling lucky I guess and went back to buying random shit (technically I never stopped doing it, there are like 200 other trades that I didn't bother mentioning, but this time specifically was just extra retarded). I don’t even remember why I got 10k worth of AMD calls but apparently I did, and there’s this one day where I was using half my port on SPY 0DTEs for some reason.  



At this point near the end of July I realized that I was being little bit too autistic, so in order to try to be slightly less autistic I went over to check out the value investing sub to and holy shit they’re even more autistic so I gave up and came back to wsb immediately. Saw some guy say that the Google antitrust remedies were coming out soon so I proceeded to full port GOOG calls a few times which yielded the biggest juiciest gains yet and boom now I’m somehow at 50k.



I just started university this year and nearly had to bag fries every summer to pay my tuition due to the fact that I am poor af, but this gain covers my entire degree, so I am genuinely thankful to this community, because without you guys I would not have found out about options. ",1026,77

2025-09-10,Google Pixel is now the fastest growing premium smartphone brand in the world,">According to new data from Counterpoint Research, the premium smartphone market is growing as of late, and Google Pixel is the fastest-growing segment. In the first half of 2025, compared to the first half of 2024, the premium smartphone market grew by roughly 8%. Keep in mind, this is the half of the year where fewer premum smartphones are launched, as the latest iPhone and other major launches tend to take place in the second half of the year.

>Counterpoint’s data reveals 105% year-over-year growth in the first half of 2025 for Google Pixel, a figure that the report attributes to “strong performance of the Pixel 9 series, expansion into newer markets and more aggressive marketing efforts.” It’s also noted that Google’s sales “doubled YoY.”",348,75

2025-09-17,GOOG ONE-TRICK FREE MONEY BULL CASE,"Jpow might fuck us today so let me give you a generational buy opp. I've been picking up goog $GOOG on every dip, and i'm here to tell you why this shit is literally free money.

**POSITION: 75% OF MY PORT.**

# THE CORE

* **SEARCH & ADS (NOT A MONOPOLY KEK).**  This is the free-money printer.
* **THE WAR CHEST (CASH AND BUYBACKS)** They're sitting on **$100B+ IN CASH** making billions in interest. AND they're pumping their own stock with a **$70B BUYBACK** program.

# THE HYPER-GROWTH

* **GEMINI: #1 APP ON THE APPLE STORE.** Their model is already the best. Rumor is **Gemini 3.0 is going to eat even more ass**. They have the best photo editing, best video generation, and just bought windsurf. They are winning the AI race right now, and it's not even close. GPT5 worse than Gemini pro v2.5 lmaoooo.  Flash cost nothing and gemini will always offer this for free
   * ""**Transformers was one of research leadership. They gave the blueprint to the entire world in June 2017, and within 12-18 months, the entire AI industry, including Google itself, was building on it.**""
* **TPUs.** This is the hardware *literally built for LLMs* (which is half the stock market now).  They can start selling the shovels in a 20-trillion-dollar gold rush.
   * ""Google was using its own large-scale, custom AI hardware for two full years before its main competitor""
* **AI INCREASING MARGIN**  They're plugging this LLMS *directly into the ad engine* and this means higher margins on their main money-printer. They're using AI to make the printer go *faster*.
* **CLOUD** \- GCP is growing at **30%+ YOY** and is ripping market share straight from AWS and Azure. This is the growth engine.

# THE MOAT

* **YOUTUBE.** This is video, streaming, TV, *everything*. It's the most-watched platform in the world, and Shorts is knee-capping TikTok BY ORACLE
* **ANDROID + PLAY STORE :** hey own the OS for **70%+ of all phones on earth**. Every app, every in-game purchase Google gets a cut. Bless apple
* \*\*CHROME .\*\*They own the browser that literally everyone uses.  They literally PAY firefox to exist.
* **GOOGLE MAPS:** It's a monopoly. Every other app (Uber, Zillow) pays Google to use their maps. Plus, it's the front door for all local ads. They own navigation.
* **WORKSPACE (Gmail/Drive)** They own the productivity suite for half the planet, and now they're plugging Gemini right into it.
* **SEARCH-DATA:** Yes they know everything about you.  Yes they have the most data in the world

# THE MOONSHOTS

* **GOOGLE VENTURES (The In-House Degen Fund)**  Did you know Google is basically a VC fund?
   * **14% of ANTHROPIC** (Valuation $200B 🚀)
   * **8% of SPACEX** (Valuation $400B 🚀)
   * ...plus they free-rolled into **UBER** and **SLACK**.
* **WAYMO:** Self-driving cars. The private market says this bet has **4x'd since last year**. This is the future of transport.
* **DEEPMIND & ISOMORPHIC LABS:** This is the AlphaFold shit. They are using AI to discover new drugs and cure diseases. This alone is a multi-trillion-dollar lotto ticket.
* **VERILY** The life-sciences bet. This shit already raised **$3.5 BILLION**. It's only going up.
* **QUANTUM** This is the long-term bet. If this pays off, they win....and they will.

# THE ""OH YEAH, THEY OWN THAT TOO"" LIST

* **HARDWARE (Pixel, Nest, Home)**
* **INFRASTRUCTURE (Google Fiber, Voice)**
* **REAL ESTATE (The Landlord)** They own infinite prime-ass real estate. Chelsea Market in NYC? That's theirs.
* **CRYPTO:** Yes. They're building a L1.

2025-09-19,$TTD DD: The Tendie Desk,"If you’ve seen my last couple posts I’ve been pretty good at picking stocks near the bottom before a bull run. CRDO, NBIS, ENTG, GLXY and most recently MNDY which I did a DD on. The problem is I’m a regard and mismanaged all of them for a loss except MNDY, but I’m rolling those gains into what I present before you today: $TTD. 

TTD is an ad tech company that has received a series of aggressive prison beatings in the market on its way to becoming S&P 500’s worst performing stock of 2025. They act as the Don Draper of advertising, so if you’re a company that wants to advertise on platforms outside of the walled gardens you don’t call each company individually you call TTD and they help you find the best spots for your money across the channels they have access to. Most of TTD’s slide this year is in reaction to the walled gardens (GOOG, AMZN, META) getting bigger because TTD doesn’t have access to youtube, prime video and ig.

[Shanked by Google, jumped by Amazon, and left holding META's lunch tray. ](https://preview.redd.it/j4cdi2znn4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3a6bef7e1489a97126b63dca60e2c49fe2ff07)

They aren’t taking this lying down, TTD bought back $647 mil between the first two quarters of 25 and have $375 mil left to use under that approval. Buybacks like this are bc the c suite is either putting their dicks on the table and saying “we’re undervalued” or they want to cook the books and boost eps. I don’t care either way because I think they’ll buoy the share price at the 52 wk low. The fed cuts also boost valuation models making future earnings look better for a growth stock like TTD. 

The DOJ vs. Goog ad tech remedies case begins next week. Guilt for Goog has already been decided, this is now about how they will change their monopoly on digital advertising by controlling both the publisher and ad exchange. DOJ is pushing for a breakup of the stack, which would give TTD access to premium inventory and be a huge tailwind. Most of the c suite for TTD has testified at one point in this trial and the CEO said “TTD managed to win in an unfair market, imagine what we could do in a fair market”. Well I’m putting my $$ on CEO Jeff Green’s imaginings. 

[Got flamed last time for posting after my position was already up so this is hot off the press.](https://preview.redd.it/m6lu0fd3o4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d54a33d6a6fbefca78b474a478c3e828bb6b776)

Final considerations are for their new AI tools and the possibility of M&A. Kokai and OpenPath will be fully launched by the end of this year, these are meaningful next gen innovations. Brands using Kokai so far have seen a 43% lower cost per household reach on ads and OpenPath has led to 39% bump in CTV revenue for clients like Vizio. If the remedies case forces Goog to make major changes, the rest of big tech could say fuck it and buy TTD given the current depressed valuation, giving better reach in the open internet and picking up a competitor. Big media like Disney or Roku could also integrate or partner to control supply path and reduce dependency, like what we just saw with Amazon and Netflix. 

Also incredibly small flyer chance TikTok’s walled garden is opened up in the US acquisition giving TTD further opportunity.",108,68

2025-09-21,Opening Discussion About RDDT,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.

2025-09-23,Can Google Avoid a Breakup Twice?,"In a landmark decision this month, a federal judge spared Google from a breakup proposed by the government to rein in the company’s monopoly in search.

Now, the company wants a second win.

Starting on Monday, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema will hear arguments in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on how to fix Google’s monopoly over some online advertising technology. The judge ruled this year that Google had broken the law to protect its dominance over the largely invisible system of technology that places ads on pages across the web. The hearing is expected to last for two to three weeks.

The Justice Department has said it wants Google to sell the technology it uses to connect buyers and sellers of ad space, among other potential remedies. Google has instead proposed measures including changing its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers.

Judge Brinkema’s ultimate decision could disrupt the company’s $3.1 trillion business and help rewrite the playbook for tech dominance in the modern internet era.

2025-09-25,That's it. I'm de-googling,"I'm not giving Google my ID for this. I'm already barely using anything Google (I already dont normally use the search engine, this was just to compare search results to test SEO of my website), but this time I'm getting rid of absolutely everything Google. I'm tired of their privacy invasions and this is just the last straw for me.

The only exception is YouTube because Google basically has a monopoly in that area. For now...

I know this sounds very over the top, but as I said, this is just the last straw. ",828,207

2025-09-29,Google age restriction is insane.,So I guess Google is now using AI to determine the age of people behind the Google accounts and then restricting things based on the age.  So now goof blocks me from using apps etc on an account I've had for almost 15 years because AI has somehow determined I'm under 18.  But that's okay because I can verify my age if I give them my credit card info or driver's license.  Google can eat bag of dicks. ,234,103

2025-09-30,"OpenAI Launching Instant Checkout, Working with Etsy(+16%) and Shopify(+6%), threatening Google(-1.2%) Search's core revenue stream.","https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/

One common argument on here is that Google's business model is not threatened by OpenAI, because the highest value searches (shopping related ones) are still done through Google, whereas OpenAI is capturing lower value queries.  So while people turn to LLMs for general questions, they still use Google for online shopping and click on sponsored ads. 

Most importantly, online retailers looking to advertise to people that are directly searching for their type of product really only had Google/Yahoo/Bing as an option, and Google had the majority of market share.

Today OpenAI killed this theory. OpenAI is in the process of integrating shopping directly into ChatGPT. It is still in its early stages, right now only supporting Etsy, and will soon rollout to Shopify. These platforms pay OpenAI for driving sales. 

CPC and CPM for Google ads are notoriously expensive, so if this goes well, expect more online retailers to implement deals with OpenAI, and cut Google ad spend as OpenAI drivers higher return on investment and such announcements boost share price. 

This is a much safer form of performance based advertising. Paying per click on Google ads is risky, because a click doesn't guarantee a sale. If OpenAI is charging a fee based on the final sale rather than per click, this makes marketing ROI much easier to predict.",259,129
