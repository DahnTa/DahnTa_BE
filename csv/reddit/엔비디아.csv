Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

*Did you know NVIDIA has a Developer Program with 150+ free SDKs, state-of-the-art Deep Learning courses, certification, and access to expert help. Sound interesting?* [Learn more here](https://nvda.ws/3wCfH6X)*.*",318,1027

2024-10-03,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: “Demand for Blackwell is Insane”,"Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang indicated the demand for its latest GPU, Blackwell, remains on track.


""Blackwell is in full production,"" Huang said Wednesday during an interview with CNBC. ""Blackwell is as planned, and the demand for Blackwell is insane. Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.""


The Blackwell GPUs are already being released to data centers and industrial customers for artificial intelligence applications. They will be available for consumers in 2025.


""The thing that we have done with Blackwell, and what we have announced, is there is new Al infrastructure generation every year,"" Huang said. ""So, we're updating our platform every single year. If we can increase the performance, like we've done for Hopper and Blackwell ... we're effectively increasing the revenue or throughput for our customers on these infrastructures by a couple to three times each year.""


Hyperscalers are expected to spend about $160B in 2024 on Al infrastructure. Every frontier large language model requires many times more compute power than the one prior.


""At a time when technology is moving so fast, it gives us an opportunity to triple down and to really drive the innovation cycle so that we can increase capabilities, increase our throughput, decrease our costs, decrease our energy consumption,"" Huang added.",596,136

2024-10-04,June 2026 - where will NVDA be?,"I was looking at the option chain of NVDA, to hedge my portfolio. Current P/E, P/S and most metrics point to stellar growth expectations. If that's the case, why is $200 Call for June 2026 priced 'just' at $15. $240 Call (double of current price) is trading at $10.

[NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Options Chain - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/options/?date=1781740800) 

It's an almost certainty that NVDA should double in next 18 months, or even sooner. So why wouldn't someone just get this option for $10, and free up his $110 capital for something else?

I know, the option can become worthless if price stays below $240. But if I am getting into something as volatile as NVDA, I'm looking to 2X my capital; and not 'normal' 20-30% gains. So, isn't it better to just ""throw"" $10 at NVDA option, if the end-result is basically the same as investing $120 in it?",0,19

2024-10-18,"Jensen's ""Rough Justice"" Philosophy of Doing Business","Early this morning, TSMC's current CEO joked that despite their rising gross margin, it still doesn't compare to Nvidia's current 75% gross margin.

It reminded me of how former TSMC CEO Rick Tsai shared his story about working with Jensen for my book THE NVIDIA WAY. Tsai managed the Nvidia relationship.

When TSMC first began working with Nvidia in the late 1990s, the industry operated on a smaller scale. Tsai recalled building his first eight-inch-wafer fabrication plant for $395 million, an amount that would only buy a single chip-making machine today.

Within years, Nvidia's success made it one of TSMC's top customers. Tsai remembered Jensen negotiating hard over pricing, repeatedly emphasizing Nvidia's low 38% gross margin at the time. How times have changed!

While working out one particular dispute, Tsai recalled how Jensen taught him a philosophy of doing business called ""rough justice."" Jensen explained that ""rough"" meant the relationship had ups and downs, while justice meant it would balance out over time. For instance, one side might occasionally get a better deal say 60-40 or 40-60, but it would be a good partnership if it netted out to roughly 50-50 over a few years. Tsai recalled thinking Jensen's approach made a great deal of sense.

""His brilliance and charisma were obvious from the beginning,"" Tsai said. ""Of course, he's not shy about calling me when our wafers were not coming out in time for him. Not shy at all. But together, we met and resolved many adversities. If you look at both companies, you cannot find a better partnership over the last three decades.""",10,6

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

2024-10-24,"Nvidia supplier SK Hynix posts record Q3 profit, beats forecasts","SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's SK Hynix on Thursday posted a record quarterly profit as the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) supplier saw strong sales of its advanced chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) ones used in generative AI chipsets.

The world's second-biggest memory chipmaker reported a 7 trillion won ($5.07 billion) operating profit for the July-September quarter versus a 1.8 trillion won loss a year earlier.

That compared with a 6.8 trillion won average forecast by LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward analysts who are more consistently accurate.

SK Hynix has outperformed rivals Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) in recent quarters, as it has benefited the most from AI-driven appetite for high-end memory chips following its early entry and large investments in HBM chip development.

""HBM sales showed excellent growth, up more than 70% from the previous quarter and more than 330% from the same period last year,"" SK Hynix said in a statement.

SK Hynix sees HBM sales making up 40% of its total DRAM revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 30% in the third quarter, and added it expects memory chip demand for AI servers to grow further next year as global tech companies continue developing generative AI.

Revenue for the quarter rose 94% year-on-year to 17.6 trillion won.

SK Hynix shares have jumped 38.5% so far this year, outperforming Samsung, whose stocks has slumped 24.7% over the same period.

The world's second-biggest memory chipmaker reported a 7 trillion won ($5.07 billion) operating profit for the July-September quarter versus a 1.8 trillion won loss a year earlier.

That compared with a 6.8 trillion won average forecast by LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward analysts who are more consistently accurate.

SK Hynix has outperformed rivals Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) in recent quarters, as it has benefited the most from AI-driven appetite for high-end memory chips following its early entry and large investments in HBM chip development.

""HBM sales showed excellent growth, up more than 70% from the previous quarter and more than 330% from the same period last year,"" SK Hynix said in a statement.

SK Hynix sees HBM sales making up 40% of its total DRAM revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 30% in the third quarter, and added it expects memory chip demand for AI servers to grow further next year as global tech companies continue developing generative AI.

Revenue for the quarter rose 94% year-on-year to 17.6 trillion won.

SK Hynix shares have jumped 38.5% so far this year, outperforming Samsung, whose stocks has slumped 24.7% over the same period.

2024-11-02,NVDA To Join Dow Jones Industrial Average,"

Nvidia is replacing rival chipmaker Intel
 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a shakeup to the blue-chip index that reflects the boom in artificial intelligence and a major shift in the semiconductor industry.  

The switch will take place on Nov. 8. Also, Sherwin Williams will replace Dow Inc
in the index, S&P Dow Jones said in a statement.

Nvidia shares have climbed over 170% so far in 2024 after jumping roughly 240% last year, as investors have rushed to get a piece of the AI chipmaker. Nvidia’s market cap has swelled to $3.3 trillion, second only to Apple.

2024-11-03,Why I think TSM/INTC will outpace NVDA/AMD growth in the next decade. ,"Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending billions of CapEx on AI. Lets just look at their last 2 quarters spending:

* **Amazon**: Increased CapEx from $60 billion in Q2 2024 to $70 billion in Q3 2024.
* **Google**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion in the same period.
* **Microsoft**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion.
* **Meta**: Increased CapEx from $29 billion to $31 billion.

However not all that CapEx is going to third party AI solutions like Nvidia/AMD. Each and every company listed above has or is developing it's own custom AI silicon.

Lets look how they are transitioning from 3rd party to In-House AI silicon:

**Amazon**: Developed AWS Inferentia and Tranium chips for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Google**: Developed Tensor Processing Unite (TPU) and Axion chip for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

**Microsoft**: Developed Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Meta**: Developed Meta trading and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

All those developments reduce dependence on external GPU suppliers, allow more customized/efficient AI processing and most importantly huge cost savings.

Just to understand the level of savings (and why would they invest huge R&D budget on this):

A **regular Nvidia H100 GPU**, cost approximately **$3,320** to manufacture from TSMC. However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each!

That's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon.

As more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings)  TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client)

And this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

Both are two totally different markets and all, but am considering selling my CMG share and dumping them in NVDA. Thoughts? ",0,28
2024-11-14,"AMD to lay off 4% of workforce, or about 1,000 employees","AMD said on Wednesday that it will lay off 4% of its global staff as the longtime computer chipmaker seeks to gain a stronger foothold in the growing artificial intelligence chip space dominated by Nvidia.

*″*As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” an AMD representative said in a statement. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.”

AMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

AMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

AMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.

GPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

AMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.

i mainly play fortnite , so i dont want to go overkill but im willing to pay whats necessary for 360fps in game although ill only be running 240fps on a 144hz monitor (Looking at upgrading that soon as well for 240hz gaming but i want the headroom )i find the 1660ti does just fine but i want my system to handle it all with less stress for smoother experience.

2024-11-29,Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost.

2024-11-30,Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

2024-12-13,Question on whether I should take some profit on Nvidia and reinvest.,"For context, I am 25 years old and from the UK. 

I bought 5 shares of Nvidia in late May 2020. 
Fast forward to today and they have obviously risen considerably and I have seen multiple stocks splits. 

I have been investing in SP500 and other stocks in the meantime too, and would say that my stake in NVDA now accounts for about 38% of my portfolio.

My question is whether I should reduce my position, take out the profits and put them back into an ETF?

Alternatively, I’m thinking that  I’m young and can take the risk to see a potential greater upside over the next 5-10 years?

The firm will present you with the basic facts about NVDA, not as, and never as, a financial recommendation, but as an introduction to its financials, to give you a better idea if it's even worth your time to further explore NVDA as a company and potential vehicle of investment. The firm does not want you to be falsely misled into thinking we can offer you expertise on NVDA, we cannot. We can however answer the questions that we would expect any man who'd risk his capital to answer. How much money does NVDA make? How much do they have? And you would think, most importantly, how much has NVDA paid their previous investors so far? And while we don't believe the answers to these questions to justify investment, this firm adamantly believes that not knowing the answers to these questions is unacceptable for those who do or would choose to buy common stock in NVDA. 

In short, you'd have to be a fucking idiot to lend your money to a company without reading our charts and commentary, or the equivalent there of. To assess the full risk of NVDA however, will require a much deeper dive than a single blog post can provide.

Let’s take a look at what investors were thinking during the ChatGPT hype and whether that investment panned out at a fundamental rather than speculative level. In other words, did NVDA actually make more money or did its share price just go up?

https://imgur.com/wRnNWlD

This graph shows what percentage of NVDA’s share price was being represented by the money it had made (ttm net income/shares/share price). This 10 year low during 2023, shows unequivically that there was in fact investment hype during this time, that the price per earnings went very high as people were willing to accept less than 1% earnings just to get in on the hype. Why would investors accept such low earnings per dollar? Because these investors anticipated that the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and the AI hype around it, would mean a growth for NVDA that would more than make up for the price they paid. So were they dumb? Did they overpay? Let’s find out! 

For our example, we’ll imagine an investor that bought sometime in February after the 100m user threshold was announced:

February 15th, 2023
  $22.75 price
  $0.175 net income
  $0.175/$22.75 = ~0.8% 


December 10th, 2024
  ~$2.57 net income
  $2.57/$22.17 = ~11% 


If an investor had bought sometime in February after the news of the 100m users was released. Let’s say for example February 15th at a closing price of approximately $22.75 per share they would have bought when NVDA’s trailing twelve month net income was about $0.175 (17.5 cents) per share, or about 0.8% of the price of the share at that time. Today, those same shares carry about $2.57 per share, a wopping 10x increase (almost 15 actually) in just 2 years. $2.57/$22.75 = ~11%, which means investors that bought in on the AI hype are already seeing the net income of their shares exceed the growth rate of the money supply (M2), which is about 7-8%. Meaning that NVDA isn’t just earning more dollars, its earning a greater share of the economic pie, and in a world where profits are actually returned to investors, would mean beating inflation (at least from a micro perspective). Now whether this cash that NVDA is reporting to generate will ever actually make it back to the shareholder is another story.

Now that we’ve seen that buying (even when the fundamental value of the shares was at its lowest) has paid off, let’s take a look at how much money NVDA actually has:

https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj
https://imgur.com/6KPxWte

As you can see, NVDA has almost no money relative to its price. The market’s pricing of NVDA is derived principally from the money it is supposed to make in the future, rather than the present value of the company.

This is not what the firm would deem a good fundamental investment. Why? Because one would be paying a future price for future value, rather than the current price for its current value. Furthermore, the market is a game of desperation, and if shareholders are desperate for money, they should be offering their shares below the liquidation value of the company. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush after all. 

However, if one understands that NVDA’s price has been based on the growth of its earnings, and if one can also see that the growth of said earnings has gone up, but its stock price has gone down (as is the case for NVDA at the time of this post ~$135) then one could speculate that the market will not only price NVDA’s earnings higher than they are currently being priced, but that the market will actually price its earnings higher than in the previous quarters unless the market believes that NVDA’s future growth will be lower. The firm believes that within the next 3 months, NVDA will almost certainly attain new all time highs. In fact, we believe the passive participant in the market, will be genuinely surprised by how high the price of NVDA will go. At the time of this post, the firm has no positions in NVDA. An associate of the firm has exposure to NVDA through long options on the SNP500. A position the firm feels is not worth mentioning as longing the SNP500 might as well be a long on inflation.

So NVDA has made all this money? How much of that money has been returned to shareholders? 
https://imgur.com/RANJVwo

As you can see by that line at the bottom, almost none. About half of the money has been spent on share buybacks and when the company’s evaluation is 50x the money that it makes and 50x the money that it has, these buybacks only break even once the company has actually grown 50x (less so if you’re only evaluating the company on past earnings and not the amount of money it actually has, in this case, you might only want a 5x to consider yourself breaking even) . I’d much rather have my money now and use it to make more money, than wait around for NVDA to 50x. But NVDA doesnt give shareholders the option of how to spend their own money or how to evaluate the company. They don’t give the money to the shareholder to decide whether they want to wait for a 50x gain on NVDA. They’ve decided they’ll spend it for you. Not on growing the company or acquiring others, but by buying their own stock. 

Now that we can understand a basic view of NVDA’s finances and how it relates to its price, let’s take a glance at some of the more sinister aspects of NVDA.

First is this little tidbit the firm discovered while reading NVDA’s Q2 filing:
https://imgur.com/b438cbJ

NVDA expects you to follow **ALL**  6 of its listed social media accounts and will be leaving out material information in its 10Q and 10k filings that will only be available in its listed social media accounts. This is clearly unethical, and our firm at this time questions whether this intent to distribute exclusive material information across 6 different channels is even legal. Though we do not have the legal training or background to make a claim one way or the other, we would like to assume that the system in place would not allow such a thing.

Now lets throw a bone to the hardware guys. If you’ve never heard of Moore’s Law, you can skip this section as trying to understand what Moore’s Law means will get in the way of seeing the blatant contradiction between NVDA’s CEO and his company’s own SEC filings. For your time:

   Moore's Law is the observation that the  number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years.

   The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel

   From Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law


So why is the firm bringing up Moore’s Law? We don’t even know what half that sentence means, and we certainly wouldnt be able to explain the nuances of NVDA’s hardware products. Well, there’s one thing we do know, it’s how to bullshit. So let’s wind back the clocks to the end of 2022. September. Right before entering Q4.

“Moore’s Law’s dead,” Huang said, “And the ability for Moore’s Law to deliver twice the performance at the same cost, or at the same performance, half the cost, every year and a half, is over. It’s completely over, and so the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time, unfortunately, is a story of the past.”

Source: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moores-laws-dead-nvidia-ceo-jensen-says-in-justifying-gaming-card-price-hike-11663798618



Ok, so going into Q4, Moore’s Law is dead. The CEO said it’s over baby. Rapid growth is a thing of the past. That means the market should be lowering its growth expectations for NVDA right?

https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj
https://imgur.com/6KPxWte

But it did the opposite. Investors were willing to pay more for less, implying they actually expected NVDA’s long term growth rate to increase not decrease. Almost as if the market knew what NVDA would end up publishing in its Q4 filing:

Source: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001045810/000104581023000017/nvda-20230129.htm

(10k filed Feb 24, 2023)

So not only did the company contradict the CEO’s statements made in the September prior to the reported quarter, now theyre actually ahead of Moore’s law, and according to them, giving the entire industry a path forward. What the fuck. 🤣

And to finish things off, we’ll put on our tin foil hats. The firm does not know how to verify the veracity of the following information. 

There has been a short report put out by Hindenburg Research regarding SMCI:

    https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/



The firm has no idea if the information reported is true. So this last section is just for fun. If the information in the report is true, then the firm would conclude that it paints the picture that SMCI has been funneling money out of the company into other companies, out of shareholder hands, into the hands of insiders and their network of family and friends. SMCI’s biggest customer? NVDA. In other words, if the allegations are accurate, the biggest chunk of money that SMCI funneled out came from NVDA. So it’s really not outside the realm of possibility that NVDA was intentionally buying from SMCI knowing where the money was ending up. The firm is not in the practice of lawsuits or building criminal cases. So the firm cannot and has no intention of doing so here for you now. The firm, however, is also not stupid. And the fact that all this money the company is making is not ending up in shareholders pockets, really isnt helping the “management would never steal from shareholders” fantasy that many would like to be the truism that must be disproved with mountains of evidence. It should have to be proven that the money is being returned to investors, not the other way around. When the vast majority of the profits dont go to the investors, which we can see from the dividend chart, but get spent on buybacks at 50x multiples, well people start to listen when accusations start to be made about money being funneled into other companies.

We’ve learned a lot. We’ve seen the impressive growth of NVDA’s earnings and how they relate to its price and the general hype around AI. We’ve shown that the company has barely any money at all and is being priced on future earnings. We’ve shown where some of this money is going. And we even got to put on our conspiracy hats for a little bit. 

And that is our fundamental analysis of NVDA, the AI giant. The good, the bad, and the fugly. Thanks for tuning in.

This is clearly unethical, and our firm at this time questions whether this intent to distribute exclusive material information across 6 different channels is even legal. Though we do not have the legal training or background to make a claim one way or the other, we would like to assume that the system in place would not allow such a thing.

Now lets throw a bone to the hardware guys. If you’ve never heard of Moore’s Law, you can skip this section as trying to understand what Moore’s Law means will get in the way of seeing the blatant contradiction between NVDA’s CEO and his company’s own SEC filings. For your time:

   Moore's Law is the observation that the  number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years.

   The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel

   From Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law


So why is the firm bringing up Moore’s Law? We don’t even know what half that sentence means, and we certainly wouldnt be able to explain the nuances of NVDA’s hardware products. Well, there’s one thing we do know, it’s how to bullshit. So let’s wind back the clocks to the end of 2022. September. Right before entering Q4.

“Moore’s Law’s dead,” Huang said, “And the ability for Moore’s Law to deliver twice the performance at the same cost, or at the same performance, half the cost, every year and a half, is over. It’s completely over, and so the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time, unfortunately, is a story of the past.”

Ok, so going into Q4, Moore’s Law is dead. The CEO said it’s over baby. Rapid growth is a thing of the past. That means the market should be lowering its growth expectations for NVDA right?

But it did the opposite. Investors were willing to pay more for less, implying they actually expected NVDA’s long term growth rate to increase not decrease. Almost as if the market knew what NVDA would end up publishing in its Q4 filing:

(10k filed Feb 24, 2023)

So not only did the company contradict the CEO’s statements made in the September prior to the reported quarter, now theyre actually ahead of Moore’s law, and according to them, giving the entire industry a path forward. What the fuck. 🤣

And to finish things off, we’ll put on our tin foil hats. The firm does not know how to verify the veracity of the following information. 

There has been a short report put out by Hindenburg Research regarding SMCI:

    https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/



The firm has no idea if the information reported is true. So this last section is just for fun. If the information in the report is true, then the firm would conclude that it paints the picture that SMCI has been funneling money out of the company into other companies, out of shareholder hands, into the hands of insiders and their network of family and friends. SMCI’s biggest customer? NVDA. In other words, if the allegations are accurate, the biggest chunk of money that SMCI funneled out came from NVDA. So it’s really not outside the realm of possibility that NVDA was intentionally buying from SMCI knowing where the money was ending up. The firm is not in the practice of lawsuits or building criminal cases. So the firm cannot and has no intention of doing so here for you now. The firm, however, is also not stupid. And the fact that all this money the company is making is not ending up in shareholders pockets, really isnt helping the “management would never steal from shareholders” fantasy that many would like to be the truism that must be disproved with mountains of evidence. It should have to be proven that the money is being returned to investors, not the other way around. When the vast majority of the profits dont go to the investors, which we can see from the dividend chart, but get spent on buybacks at 50x multiples, well people start to listen when accusations start to be made about money being funneled into other companies.

We’ve learned a lot. We’ve seen the impressive growth of NVDA’s earnings and how they relate to its price and the general hype around AI. We’ve shown that the company has barely any money at all and is being priced on future earnings. We’ve shown where some of this money is going. And we even got to put on our conspiracy hats for a little bit. 

And that is our fundamental analysis of NVDA, the AI giant. The good, the bad, and the fugly. Thanks for tuning in.

2024-12-15,Question on whether I should take some profit on Nvidia and reinvest.,"For context, I am 25 years old and from the UK. 

I bought 5 shares of Nvidia in late May 2020. 
Fast forward to today and they have obviously risen considerably and I have seen multiple stocks splits. 

I have been investing in SP500 and other stocks in the meantime too, and would say that my stake in NVDA now accounts for about 38% of my portfolio.

My question is whether I should reduce my position, take out the profits and put them back into an ETF?

Alternatively, I’m thinking that  I’m young and can take the risk to see a potential greater upside over the next 5-10 years?


What would your advice be? Many thanks in advance.",4,15
2024-12-15,NVDA Fundamental Analysis w/ Charts,"There is no shortage of dollars or bullshit when it comes to NVDA, the world's AI GPU hero of heroes. And with NVDA's revenue and profits not just increasing but multiplying in such a short timespan, investors want to know is it still a good time to buy, to catch the AI wave, as it builds and crashes upon the world, both that of capital investment and the greater world at large. 

Revenue and profits multiplying:

And here’s the chart that shows the impact of ChatGPT on the share price and earnings:

https://imgur.com/SxhIF9z

The top line is the price investors are paying. 

The bottom line is what those investors are getting, so to speak (NVDA’s net income over the previous year (trailing twelve months)) 

The vertical line roughly represents ChatGPT hitting 100m users with the line at 2023 January 1st and ChatGPT reportedely hitting 100m users sometime in that month of January according to Reuters and The Guardian.

The firm will present you with the basic facts about NVDA, not as, and never as, a financial recommendation, but as an introduction to its financials, to give you a better idea if it's even worth your time to further explore NVDA as a company and potential vehicle of investment. The firm does not want you to be falsely misled into thinking we can offer you expertise on NVDA, we cannot. We can however answer the questions that we would expect any man who'd risk his capital to answer. How much money does NVDA make? How much do they have? And you would think, most importantly, how much has NVDA paid their previous investors so far? And while we don't believe the answers to these questions to justify investment, this firm adamantly believes that not knowing the answers to these questions is unacceptable for those who do or would choose to buy common stock in NVDA. 

In short, you'd have to be a fucking idiot to lend your money to a company without reading our charts and commentary, or the equivalent there of. To assess the full risk of NVDA however, will require a much deeper dive than a single blog post can provide.

Let’s take a look at what investors were thinking during the ChatGPT hype and whether that investment panned out at a fundamental rather than speculative level. In other words, did NVDA actually make more money or did its share price just go up?

https://imgur.com/wRnNWlD

This graph shows what percentage of NVDA’s share price was being represented by the money it had made (ttm net income/shares/share price). This 10 year low during 2023, shows unequivically that there was in fact investment hype during this time, that the price per earnings went very high as people were willing to accept less than 1% earnings just to get in on the hype. Why would investors accept such low earnings per dollar? Because these investors anticipated that the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and the AI hype around it, would mean a growth for NVDA that would more than make up for the price they paid. So were they dumb? Did they overpay? Let’s find out! 

For our example, we’ll imagine an investor that bought sometime in February after the 100m user threshold was announced:

February 15th, 2023
  $22.75 price
  $0.175 net income
  $0.175/$22.75 = ~0.8% 


December 10th, 2024
  ~$2.57 net income
  $2.57/$22.17 = ~11% 


If an investor had bought sometime in February after the news of the 100m users was released. Let’s say for example February 15th at a closing price of approximately $22.75 per share they would have bought when NVDA’s trailing twelve month net income was about $0.175 (17.5 cents) per share, or about 0.8% of the price of the share at that time. Today, those same shares carry about $2.57 per share, a wopping 10x increase (almost 15 actually) in just 2 years. $2.57/$22.75 = ~11%, which means investors that bought in on the AI hype are already seeing the net income of their shares exceed the growth rate of the money supply (M2), which is about 7-8%. Meaning that NVDA isn’t just earning more dollars, its earning a greater share of the economic pie, and in a world where profits are actually returned to investors, would mean beating inflation (at least from a micro perspective). Now whether this cash that NVDA is reporting to generate will ever actually make it back to the shareholder is another story.

Now that we’ve seen that buying (even when the fundamental value of the shares was at its lowest) has paid off, let’s take a look at how much money NVDA actually has:

https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj
https://imgur.com/6KPxWte

As you can see, NVDA has almost no money relative to its price. The market’s pricing of NVDA is derived principally from the money it is supposed to make in the future, rather than the present value of the company.

This is not what the firm would deem a good fundamental investment. Why? Because one would be paying a future price for future value, rather than the current price for its current value. Furthermore, the market is a game of desperation, and if shareholders are desperate for money, they should be offering their shares below the liquidation value of the company. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush after all. 

However, if one understands that NVDA’s price has been based on the growth of its earnings, and if one can also see that the growth of said earnings has gone up, but its stock price has gone down (as is the case for NVDA at the time of this post ~$135) then one could speculate that the market will not only price NVDA’s earnings higher than they are currently being priced, but that the market will actually price its earnings higher than in the previous quarters unless the market believes that NVDA’s future growth will be lower. The firm believes that within the next 3 months, NVDA will almost certainly attain new all time highs. In fact, we believe the passive participant in the market, will be genuinely surprised by how high the price of NVDA will go. At the time of this post, the firm has no positions in NVDA. An associate of the firm has exposure to NVDA through long options on the SNP500. A position the firm feels is not worth mentioning as longing the SNP500 might as well be a long on inflation.

So NVDA has made all this money? How much of that money has been returned to shareholders? 
https://imgur.com/RANJVwo

As you can see by that line at the bottom, almost none. About half of the money has been spent on share buybacks and when the company’s evaluation is 50x the money that it makes and 50x the money that it has, these buybacks only break even once the company has actually grown 50x (less so if you’re only evaluating the company on past earnings and not the amount of money it actually has, in this case, you might only want a 5x to consider yourself breaking even) . I’d much rather have my money now and use it to make more money, than wait around for NVDA to 50x. But NVDA doesnt give shareholders the option of how to spend their own money or how to evaluate the company. They don’t give the money to the shareholder to decide whether they want to wait for a 50x gain on NVDA. They’ve decided they’ll spend it for you. Not on growing the company or acquiring others, but by buying their own stock. 

Now that we can understand a basic view of NVDA’s finances and how it relates to its price, let’s take a glance at some of the more sinister aspects of NVDA.

First is this little tidbit the firm discovered while reading NVDA’s Q2 filing:
https://imgur.com/b438cbJ

NVDA expects you to follow **ALL**  6 of its listed social media accounts and will be leaving out material information in its 10Q and 10k filings that will only be available in its listed social media accounts.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

>\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

Key Findings

\- Comparing on paper FLOP/s and HBM Bandwidth/Capacity is akin to comparing cameras by merely examining megapixel count. The only way to tell the actual performance is to run benchmarking.

\- Nvidia’s Out of the Box Performance & Experience is amazing, and we did not run into any Nvidia specific bugs during our benchmarks. Nvidia tasked a single engineer to us for technical support, but we didn’t run into any Nvidia software bugs as such we didn’t need much support.

\- AMD’s Out of the Box Experience is very difficult to work with and can require considerable patience and elbow grease to move towards a usable state. On most of our benchmarks, Public AMD stable releases of AMD PyTorch is still broken and we needed workarounds.

\- If we weren’t supported by multiple teams of AMD engineers triaging and fixing bugs in AMD software that we ran into, AMD’s results would have been much lower than Nvidia’s.

2024-12-24,Nvidia will moon - In Depth Benchmarking tests of AMD MX300 vs Nvidia H100 and H200 by SemiAnalysis,"tl:dr - the world is as expected. AMD's software needs lots of hand holding and support, Nvidia's runs very well right out of the box. Nvidia maintains performance advantage in nearly every test run. [https://semianalysis.com/2024/12/22/mi300x-vs-h100-vs-h200-benchmark-part-1-training/](https://semianalysis.com/2024/12/22/mi300x-vs-h100-vs-h200-benchmark-part-1-training/)

  
Key Findings

\- Comparing on paper FLOP/s and HBM Bandwidth/Capacity is akin to comparing cameras by merely examining megapixel count. The only way to tell the actual performance is to run benchmarking.

\- Nvidia’s Out of the Box Performance & Experience is amazing, and we did not run into any Nvidia specific bugs during our benchmarks. Nvidia tasked a single engineer to us for technical support, but we didn’t run into any Nvidia software bugs as such we didn’t need much support.

\- AMD’s Out of the Box Experience is very difficult to work with and can require considerable patience and elbow grease to move towards a usable state. On most of our benchmarks, Public AMD stable releases of AMD PyTorch is still broken and we needed workarounds.

\- If we weren’t supported by multiple teams of AMD engineers triaging and fixing bugs in AMD software that we ran into, AMD’s results would have been much lower than Nvidia’s.

Taiwan's Foxconn (2317.TW), opens new tab, the world's largest contract electronics maker, beat expectations to post its highest-ever revenue for the fourth quarter on continued strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) servers.


Revenue for Apple's biggest iPhone assembler jumped 15.2% to T$2.13 trillion ($64.72 billion), Foxconn said in a statement on Sunday.


It was also ahead of a T$2.1 trillion LSEG SmartEstimate, which gives greater weight to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurat

Robust AI server demand led to strong revenue growth for its cloud and networking products division, said Foxconn, whose customers include AI chip firm Nvidia.


For smart consumer electronics, which includes iPhones, there was ""roughly flattish"" year-on-year growth, it said.


Total revenue in December alone reached T$654.8 billion, up 42.3% year on year and the second-highest ever level for the month.

In the first quarter of 2025, overall operations have gradually entered the traditional off-season,"" Foxconn said of its outlook for the current quarter.


""Even with record high revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024, the sequential performance of the first quarter will reach roughly similar levels that are average to the past five years; compared with a year ago, it should show significant growth.""",134,7

Given that nVidia and AMD basically only talked about AI in their presentations, I believe that they are comparing the performance of **AI Accelerated Tasks**, so whatever slides you saw in the Keynote are useless to you.


*EDIT: Some people seem to be interpreting that I am hating on the RTX 5070 or nVidia products in general. **No, I am only hating on the specific comparison because of how quickly the internet made wrong statements based on incorrect caveats about the comparison.***

*In my opinion and assuming it doesn't get scalped, the RTX 5070 will probably be the recommended current generation card that I would recommend for people that have cards that don't have Ray Tracing or first generation Ray Tracing to play today's current titles (including the ones that require Ray tracing) because the performance is there and the price seems better compared to the last two generations.*",1788,516

2025-01-07,Why Nvidia Is Poised to Lead The Robotics Industry ,,0,0
2025-01-08,[Advice] Opinions on covered call strategy with NVDA.,"I currently own about 64 shares of Nvidia stock at about $114 avg price. I will probably have the opportunity to make a full 100 shares within the next month or two, and I’ve been considering doing that just to run a covered call strategy with it while continuing to hold NVDA long-term.

Would I be better selling calls weekly or monthly? 

From what I can see I should be able to generate at least $350 to $400 a month or so which would be up to $4800 annualized. 

As of now, I believe I would just periodically reinvest the money directly back into Nvidia to build the position long-term. I also do realize I will pay capital gains on the money received from selling the calls. I have a small business with many legitimate write offs to hopefully help with that part.

 I understand the concept more or less and have used the strategy in the past with moderate success on much cheaper stocks. I also understand that I can buy back, roll up down, etc. 

Any thoughts or suggestions on ways to improve or optimize this strategy would be appreciated, thanks!",4,3
2025-01-08,Nvidia: Expect Valuation To Soar Higher On 2025's AI Spending Increases,"# Summary

* Nvidia’s 2024 revenue surged by 86% to $113.3 billion, with operating income doubling to $71 billion.
* Hyperscalers are expected to increase AI-focused capital expenditures by 50% in 2025, reaching $300 billion.
* Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell architecture offers up to 15x performance improvements, securing its 90% market dominance in AI GPUs.
* Competitors like AMD and Broadcom struggle with ecosystem integration and software optimization, solidifying Nvidia’s lead.
* Analysts project a 50x earnings multiple and a target price of $225 per share for 2025.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) enjoyed unprecedented financial success in 2024, driven by a wave of hyperscaler investments in data center infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Revenues soared by 86%, reaching $113.3 billion, while operating income more than doubled to $71 billion, signaling the company’s dominance in the AI sector.

Despite such robust growth, concerns over a potential slowdown are misplaced. The global push toward AI and machine learning shows no signs of waning. Leading technology giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Google are significantly expanding their high-performance computing capabilities to meet the surging demand for generative AI, large language models, and advanced AI applications.

In 2024, hyperscaler capital expenditures on data centers totaled approximately $200 billion. For 2025, this figure is projected to rise by 50%, hitting $300 billion. According to Morgan Stanley, Amazon and Microsoft are set to lead this spending spree with investments of $96.4 billion and $89.9 billion, respectively. Google and Meta will closely follow, allocating $62.6 billion and $52.3 billion to their AI-driven infrastructure.

This aggressive investment is underpinned by statements from top executives. Google’s CFO noted that while growth in capital expenditures won’t match the leap between 2023 and 2024, further increases are expected. Similarly, Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted plans for significant growth in infrastructure spending. Microsoft, too, has committed $80 billion for AI-oriented data center construction in fiscal 2025.

Nvidia, with its 90% share of the AI GPU market, is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this surge in spending. The release of its next-generation Blackwell architecture in early 2025 promises substantial performance gains, including up to 2.5 times the training performance of its Hopper GPUs and as much as 15 times higher inference capabilities in select benchmarks. These advancements, paired with Nvidia’s proprietary CUDA platform, reinforce its unassailable ecosystem of hardware and software solutions.

Competitors like AMD and Broadcom continue to face hurdles. AMD’s MI300X GPUs, while promising on paper, have failed to deliver comparable performance due to software deficiencies. Broadcom’s custom silicon projects, although intriguing, lack the versatility and support ecosystem Nvidia GPUs provide. Consequently, neither competitor poses a significant threat in the near term, with meaningful competition unlikely before 2026 or 2027.

# TL;DR

Nvidia’s remarkable 2024 growth, fueled by hyperscaler investments, will continue as AI spending surges 50% in 2025 to $300 billion. With its dominant 90% GPU market share and groundbreaking Blackwell architecture, Nvidia is well-positioned for further success.

# There were three big announcements

# New Gaming Cards

Nvidia’s new line of RTX 50 Series gaming graphics cards is based on the company’s Blackwell chip architecture. Considering the massive leap Blackwell has made over Hopper, its previous iteration in data center applications, getting it to work in gaming is a huge deal – a massive improvement with superior rendering and higher frame rates for gamers.

# Digits

The Linux-based desktop computer with the GB 10 Grace Blackwell Superchip with a CPU and GPU. A first in its history at $3,000 “Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher, and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI,” Huang said.

It may seem like a niche product for high-end engineers/professors/scientists and researchers, but I think it’s a deliberate and excellent strategy to evangelize the product, through the folks who can develop use cases and apps that can further the market for cheaper at scale mass Digits in the future.

This is straight from the Nvidia playbook from the last two decades – they have always involved the scientific and research community from the start. I can bet a large number of these are going to be distributed free to campuses.

I think Digits will turn out to be a very consequential product for Nvidia – with several billion in revenue in a few years. But forecasts aside, what’s key is that Digits uses a scaled-down version of Nvidia’s Grace AI server CPU technology. It’s packaged in a Mac Mini-sized form factor with the help of Taiwan-based **MediaTek**, which Huang commended for its expertise in building low-power chips.

Quoting Tae Kim from Barron’s who authored an excellent book on Nvidia

>Over time, the logical move for Nvidia would be to scale down this CPU further for consumer Windows laptops. By integrating its graphics expertise, MediaTek’s power-saving capabilities, and the efficiency of Arm-based CPU technology, Nvidia could create a processor that offers leading graphics for gaming and high performance for productivity, along with long battery life. While prior Arm-based Windows PCs have struggled with software compatibility, Nvidia’s top-notch software engineering could make it work.

Huang strongly hinted that the introduction of Digits was a precursor to the PC market, even as there are questions about why Nvidia chose Linux over Windows – and we should hear more about that at their GTC conference in March.

It could shake up the moribund PC market, which has been suffering from a lack of growth rates after COVID-19. Desktop PCs and laptop computers still generate large revenues for **Intel** and **Advanced Micro Devices**, the primary makers of x86-based processors – a legacy that could give way to ARM-based processors, which Apple uses. Analysts expect Intel to generate $30 billion in revenue from its client computing business in 2024, according to FactSet, while AMD has $6.7 billion in revenue in its client segment.

Billions of potential new revenue are at stake for Nvidia, which is forecasted to make about $180Bn in sales in the 12 months ending January 2026. While data center takes up the largest share of revenue at about $150Bn of that pie and gaming, auto, and professional visualization (Omniverse) take the rest, a new source would help a great deal when data center revenue growth slows down.

In the past two years, Nvidia has monopolized the AI data center market with the best-designed, highest-performing chips. Nvidia would likely make a significant dent in the PC market as well as the new paradigm in edge computing with all the computing power and constant innovation and upgrades at its disposal.

# Cosmos

The third announcement was for COSMOS – a significant improvement over their Omniverse and the biggest catalyst/enabler of “Physical AI”, I’ll write a separate note on that.

With DLSS3 I wouldn't use anything below Balanced. Even balanced I would use rarely. Now with DLSS4, at least in cyberpunk Performance looks just as good as old Quality plus they have fixed Ray Reconstruction and it actually can look even better. I would not use RR before as it looked like crap. 

So with DLSS3 in Cyberpunk I would play 1440P Quality with path tracing, no RR as it looked bad, and I would use FG. That would be 116.58 fps. With DLSS4 I can now drop to performance and enable RR to get 166.37 FPS. That's ~43%

At 4K it went from 58.70 fps(unplayable with FG) to 94.19 fps and that is around ~60%. So I can play at 4K now. 

The improved Ray Reconstruction is so good now I want it in every game.

2025-01-27,Sell side analyst notes on NVDA this morning,"BofA: 'DeepSeek Concerns Overblown in AI Semis; but Foundational Models Keep Demand High'

 ""On January 20, China-based AI lab DeepSeek created a mini-flurry in the AI semiconductor space by releasing a free, open-source R1 model that reportedly outperforms leading Western AI models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4. The model's creators claimed it took only two months and less than $6 million to build using older-generation NVIDIA H800 chips.

If accurate, this advancement suggests model usefulness and accuracy might not scale directly with compute/memory/networking, potentially reducing the demand for expensive AI chips. However, we believe this concern about slowing AI scaling is overstated. Based on available data, DeepSeek's model appears to be a 'distilled' model relying on larger foundation models like Meta's open-source Llama.

It is these foundational LLMs where significant and rising infrastructure costs are incurred, as evidenced by Meta's plan to raise CY25E capex by over 56% year-over-year to $60-$65 billion. In our view, we will continue to see increasing compute demand driven by a mix of large foundational models (both proprietary and open-source), derivative models (leveraging techniques such as knowledge distillation, sparse attention, and low-rank factorization), and inference at scale across diverse cloud, enterprise, and sovereign AI customers.

We maintain our Buy ratings on NVIDIA (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Marvell Technology (MRVL).""

JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande: ""Investors are concerned that rather than impede China's progress in AI, the US restrictions have engendered innovation that has enabled the development of a model that prioritises efficiency. ... The news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of Microsoft, which is spending $80bn in '25, while Meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn. Open AI also announced that the Stargate project intends to invest $500m over the next four years building new AI infrastructure in the US. Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek's highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible."" 

Jefferies analyst Edison Lee: ""Re-evaluating computing power needs could cause 2026 AI Capex to fall (or not grow)...We believe DS's success could drive two possible industry strategies: 1) still pursue more computing power to drive even faster model improvements, and 2) refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026."" 

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon: ""Is DeepSeek doomsday for AI buildouts? We don't think so...we believe that 1) DeepSeek DID NOT ""build OpenAI for $5M""; 2) the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and 3) the resulting Twitterverse panic over the weekend seems overblown."" Though Rasgon acknowledged DeepSeek's models are good. The analyst kept his outperform ratings on Nvidia and Broadcom, advising clients not to buy into the doomsday scenarios. 

Citi analyst Malik: ""While the dominance of the US companies on the most advanced AI models could be potentially challenged, that said, we estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US' access to more advanced chips is an advantage. Thus, we don't expect leading AI companies would move away from more advanced GPUs."" Malik maintained a buy rating on Nvidia . 

Raymond James' semiconductor analyst Srini Pajjuri: ""If DeepSeek's innovations are adopted broadly, an argument can be made that model training costs could come down significantly even at U.S. hyperscalers, potentially raising questions about the need for 1-million XPU/GPU clusters as projected by some...: A more logical implication is that DeepSeek will drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers to leverage their key advantage (access to GPUs) to distance themselves from cheaper alternatives."" Pajjuri reiterated buy ratings on Nvidia and ASML. 

Cantor analyst C.J. Muse: ""Following release of DeepSeek's V3 LLM, there has been great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs. We think this view is farthest from the truth and that the announcement is actually very bullish with AGI seemingly closer to reality and Jevons Paradox almost certainly leading to the AI industry wanting more compute, not less."" Muse said buy Nvidia on any weakness.",143,102
2025-01-27,NVDA’s DeepSeek Sell-Off: This Is a Jevons Paradox Buying Opportunity,"NVIDIA (NVDA) is down hard, dropping from $142 to $126 pre-market after hype around DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup achieving more with less compute. The market fears efficient AI models will hurt GPU demand, but this reaction misses the bigger picture.

Why This Is Bullish Long-Term

	1.	Jevons Paradox: Efficiency doesn’t reduce demand—it increases it. As AI becomes cheaper and more accessible, more businesses, startups, and individuals will adopt it, driving more GPU sales.

	2.	New Markets: Efficient models mean more local AI deployments (edge computing) and new industries adopting AI. NVIDIA’s products (DGX, Jetson, RTX GPUs) are perfectly positioned for this shift.

	3.	Redistribution, Not Decline: The demand for AI is evolving, not shrinking. NVIDIA will sell to thousands of smaller players, adding to their hyperscaler business.

	4.	Software Moat: CUDA and TensorRT ensure NVIDIA stays at the center of AI workflows, even as the market shifts.

At $126, this is classic overreaction. AI isn’t slowing—it’s expanding. NVDA is still the backbone of the industry, and this dip is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.

TL;DR: DeepSeek highlights AI’s growth, not NVIDIA’s decline. Efficiency drives broader adoption, and NVDA’s hardware/software dominance makes them a winner. Thoughts? Buying the dip?

Update: NVDA dropped to $116.94 at its lowest point today. Making it the largest one day drop of any stock, almost 600 Billion. Good luck regards. ",1978,811

2025-01-28,Markets are Overreacting to DeepSeek,"The markets are overreacting to the DeepSeek news. 

Nvidia and big tech stocks losing a trillion dollars in value is not realistic. 

I personally am buying more NVDA stock off the dip. 

So what is going on?

The reason for the drop:  Investors think DeepSeek threatens to disrupt the US big tech dominance by enabling smaller companies and cost-sensitive enterprises with an open source and low cost, high performance model. 

Here is why I think fears are overblown.

1. Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and other big tech firms have massive war chests to outspend competitors. Nvidia alone spent nearly $9 billion on R&D in 2024 and can quickly adapt to new threats by enhancing its offerings or lowering costs if necessary.

2. Nvidia’s dominance isn’t just about hardware—it’s deeply tied to its software ecosystem, particularly CUDA, which is the gold standard for AI and machine learning development. This ecosystem is entrenched in research labs, enterprises, and cloud platforms worldwide.

3. People have to understand the risk that comes with DeepSeek coming out of China. There will be major adoption barriers from key markets as folks worry about data security, sanctions, government overreach etc. 

4. US just announced $500b to AI infrastructure via Stargate. The government has substantial resourcing to subsidize or lower barriers for brands like Nvidia.

Critiques tend to fall into two camps…

1. Nvidias margins are going to be eroded 

To this I think we have to acknowledge that while lower margins and demand would impact the stock both of these are speculative. 

Increased efficiency typically increases demand. And Nvidias customers are pretty entrenched, it’s def not certain they will bleed customers. 

On top of that Nvidia’s profitability isn’t solely tied to selling GPUs. Its software stack (e.g., CUDA), enterprise services, and licensing deals contribute significantly. These high-margin revenue streams I would guess are going to remain solid even if hardware pricing pressures increase.

2. Open source has a number of relative advantages

I think open source is heavily favorited by startups and indie developers (Open source is strongly favored by Reddit specifically). But the enterprise buyer doesn’t typically lean this way.

Open-source solutions require significant internal expertise for implementation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. Large enterprises often prefer Nvidia’s support and commercial-grade stack because they get a dedicated team for ongoing updates, security patches, and scalability.",2298,818
2025-01-28,nVidia GeForce RTX 5090 Meta Review,"- compilation of 17 launch reviews with ~6260 gaming benchmarks at 1080p, 1440p, 2160p
- only benchmarks at real games compiled, not included any 3DMark & Unigine benchmarks
- geometric mean in all cases
- standard raster performance without ray-tracing and/or DLSS/FSR/XeSS
- extra ray-tracing benchmarks (mostly without upscaler) after the standard raster benchmarks
- stock performance on (usually) reference/FE boards, no overclocking
- factory overclocked cards were normalized to reference clocks/performance, but just for the overall performance average (so the listings show the original performance result, just the performance index has been normalized)
- missing results were interpolated (for a more accurate average) based on the available & former results
- performance average is (some) weighted in favor of reviews with more benchmarks
- all reviews should have used newer drivers for _all_ cards
- power draw numbers based on a couple of reviews, always for the graphics card only
- current retailer prices according to Geizhals (DE/Germany, on Jan 27) and Newegg (USA, on Jan 27) for immediately available offers
- for the 5090 retail prices of $2200 and 2500€ were assumed
- for discontinued graphics cards a typical retail price was used from the time they were sold (incl. 4080 & 4090)
- performance/price ratio (higher is better) for 2160p raster performance and 2160p ray-tracing performance

2025-01-28,The Market Is Dropping After Huge AI Breakthrough—But Isn’t This Great News?,"Today, news broke about a revolutionary AI model that’s open-source, extremely powerful, and developed with far fewer resources than ever before. This should be cause for celebration—it’s a major step forward for global productivity. Yet, the stock market is responding with a significant sell-off.

Tech-heavy companies like NVIDIA and TSMC are seeing double-digit drops (around 17%), and the broader tech sector is down \~5%. For those of us holding global index funds, this means a drop in value, as these companies carry significant weight. But here’s the puzzling part: shouldn’t this kind of breakthrough *increase* the long-term value of the total market?

Cheaper and more accessible AI means businesses across every sector can improve their efficiency, cut costs, and innovate faster. From logistics and manufacturing to healthcare and finance, the potential productivity boost is enormous. This isn’t bad news—it’s a massive opportunity for non-tech companies to thrive.

Yet, the market seems fixated on the short-term impact to companies that *develop* AI or produce the hardware for it. It’s as if the market is missing the forest for the trees. Why should the total value of all publicly traded companies *fall* on the news of a breakthrough that’s bound to make them more productive and profitable?

This feels like a moment where the market hasn’t fully priced in the reality of what this could mean. In the long run, wouldn’t a global index fund naturally benefit as this technology drives economic growth across industries?

So here’s my question to the community:

* Is the market too focused on the immediate losers (like NVIDIA or TSMC) while ignoring the broader winners?
* How can investors position themselves to reflect the long-term productivity gains from this development?
* Are there sectors, regions, or funds that might capture this shift better than a traditional global index fund?",0,23
2025-01-28,NVDA: Buying the Dip Amid DeepSeek AI and the AI Race,"

* **DeepSeek's Claims:** Released AI models (R1 and R1 Zero) claiming OpenAI-level performance with lower costs and less advanced chips, causing semiconductor stocks to drop.
* **Scalability Concerns:** Experts doubt whether DeepSeek’s approach can scale to meet the demands of growing AI adoption.
* **U.S. Export Ban:** Restrictions on advanced chip exports to China have spurred innovation but limit scaling and next-gen model development.
* **AI Adoption Still Early:** AI applications in industries like transportation, medicine, and home automation remain nascent, requiring advanced chips for growth.
* **Nvidia’s Strong Position:** Despite short-term stock dips, Nvidia’s dominance in GPUs and projected growth (EBITDA from $34.5B in 2024 to $166.8B in 2027) highlight its long-term potential.
* **Investment Case:** Continued demand for high-performance chips ensures Nvidia’s relevance in the expanding AI market.

Nvidia is currently navigating a challenging landscape as DeepSeek, a company specializing in AI models, has unveiled its DeepSeek R1 and R1 Zero models. These models claim to rival OpenAI's performance at significantly lower training costs, just $6 million, using less advanced chips. The announcement has sent shockwaves through the semiconductor industry, leading to declining stock prices for companies like Nvidia. DeepSeek's claims suggest a potential shift in AI development priorities, focusing on cost-efficiency rather than the procurement of high-end chips. However, experts remain skeptical about the scalability of this approach. As AI adoption grows, so will the need for advanced chips capable of handling increased query volumes and more complex use cases.

The U.S. export ban on high-end chips to China has added another layer of complexity to the situation. While the ban aims to limit China's access to advanced technology, it may have inadvertently spurred innovation, forcing companies like DeepSeek to achieve more with less. Despite this, scaling AI models and developing next-generation solutions still require significant computational power, which advanced chips uniquely provide. With each GPU generation, improvements in power efficiency and performance become essential for addressing growing demand, particularly as AI applications expand across industries like transportation, medicine, and home automation.

AI adoption is still in its infancy, with significant growth potential across various sectors. Autonomous vehicles, for instance, represent less than 0.002% of the global car fleet, highlighting the vast untapped opportunities for AI-driven technologies. Similarly, the use of AI in medical research, molecular science, and household appliances remains limited, indicating substantial room for expansion. As these applications evolve, they will require a robust supply of advanced chips to achieve cost-effective scalability and enhanced efficiency. Even with advancements in cost-efficient training methods, scaling AI adoption to meet global demand will depend on continued investment in high-performance chips.

Nvidia remains well-positioned to benefit from this dynamic. While its stock has faced short-term pressure, the company's dominance in the GPU market and its projected growth underscore its long-term potential. Analysts estimate Nvidia's EBITDA to grow from $34.5 billion in 2024 to $166.8 billion by 2027, with free cash flow rising at a similar pace. This growth justifies Nvidia's premium valuation and positions it as a critical player in the AI-driven future. The competition spurred by DeepSeek and similar initiatives ultimately reinforces the need for advanced chips, ensuring Nvidia's relevance and profitability in the evolving AI landscape.

**TL;DR:** Despite DeepSeek's claims of cost-effective AI model training with less advanced chips, Nvidia's leadership in the GPU market and the growing demand for advanced chips to scale AI applications make it a compelling long-term investment opportunity.",0,5

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

# NVIDIA Broadcast Update Adds New AI Effects

In the Discover section of the NVIDIA app Home tab, or from [NVIDIA.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/), you can now download a new NVIDIA Broadcast update adding two new AI-powered beta effects.

The first, Studio Voice, enhances a user’s microphone sound quality. The other, Virtual Key Light, relights the subject to deliver even lighting, as if a physical key light was defining the form and dimension of the individual.

Because they harness demanding AI models, these new beta features are recommended for video conferencing or non-gaming livestreams using a GeForce RTX 5080 or 4080 GPU, or higher. NVIDIA is working to expand these features to more GeForce RTX GPUs in future updates.

The NVIDIA Broadcast upgrade also includes an updated user interface that allows users to apply more effects simultaneously, as well as improvements to the background noise removal, virtual background and eye contact effects.

# RTX Video Super Resolution Now Supports HDR & Is More Efficient

Accessed via System > Video in NVIDIA app, RTX Video uses AI to enhance streaming video on all GeForce RTX GPUs. It has 2 features: Video Super Resolution (VSR), which removes compression artifacts, and sharpens edges when upscaling. And Video HDR, which tone maps SDR videos to HDR.

In the new NVIDIA app update, VSR has been updated to a more efficient AI model, using up to 30% fewer GPU resources at its highest quality setting, allowing more GeForce RTX GPUs to enable it.

VSR now also upscales HDR video, so if you are watching any HDR video below your monitor’s resolution in your browser, it will automatically get upscaled to your native panel resolution.

We’ve also added a GPU Utilization feature for RTX Video when Quality is set to “Auto”. Setting your GPU Utilization to “High” will use as much GPU as needed to provide the best quality Super Resolution available on your GPU.

Setting the GPU Utilization to lower levels will reserve more GPU for games or creative apps by applying lower quality settings. Or alternatively, switch to Manual mode and set a fixed quality level to use at all times.

# Advanced Optimus & Multiple Display Options

The NVIDIA app development team has converted, accelerated, and modernized two additional features from the NVIDIA Control Panel in this new release, with more on the way in the future.

Advanced Optimus enables a laptop to dynamically switch between using the GeForce GPU and integrated graphics. When performing basic tasks like word processing, the integrated processor is used. When GPU-accelerated apps or games are launched, Advanced Optimus switches to the GeForce GPU to maximize performance, to take advantage of high refresh rate displays, and to enable G-SYNC.

Now, you can control Advanced Optimus in NVIDIA app from System > Displays. Open “Display Mode”, adjust as needed, then press Apply. With “NVIDIA GPU” selected, G-SYNC options and additional Display Settings appear, ready to be configured

https://preview.redd.it/ky5qosi025ge1.png?width=2756&format=png&auto=webp&s=886ec3b0e7b9453a5720b23e7214c89963436ba6

You can determine if your laptop supports Advanced Optimus by going to System > My Rig, clicking “View Rig Details”, and scrolling down the list of items until you reach “Advanced Optimus”.

2025-01-31,"Globally force DLSS4 Preset K, using only official Driver and NPI, without copying any DLL files and without using the Nvidia App to override on a game by game basis.","So the new driver is out, and the updated Nvidia App is out. And as I thought, DLSS 4 override has to be manually applied on a game by game basis.

But here is how to globally apply the DLSS 4 override with the latest preset, doing it once for all games, using only the latest official Geforce driver and nvidiaProfileInspector.

***Before starting, UNINSTALL existing driver and Nvidia App***, I recommend using [DDU](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) for a clean uninstall.

**- Step 1** is to download the latest Nvidia Geforce driver from [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/) and install only the Gameready driver, **without** the Nvidia App. (latest version 580.88)

**- Step 2** is to download the latest nvidiaProfileInspector from [here](https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases) (latest version 2.4.0.20) and use it stock, without any custom settings files.

**- Step 3** is to open nvidiaProfileInspector (remain in the \_Global\_Driver\_Profile), and in the ""5 - Common"" section apply the following values:

DLSS - Enable DLL Override  ->  On - DLSS overridden by latest available

DLSS - Forced Preset Letter  ->  Always use latest

DLSS-RR - Enable DLL Override  ->  On - DLSS-RR overridden by latest available

DLSS-RR - Forced Preset Letter  ->  Always use latest

*For RTX 4000/5000 series only :*

DLSS-FG - Enable DLL Override  ->  On - DLSS-FG overridden by latest available

Hit ***Apply changes*** in the top right corner, and **restart** your PC for good measure.

And that is it. It will bypass the DLSS dll files that are in the game's directories, and use the DLSS dll files that come with the Nvidia driver.

If you want to make sure it works, follow [this guide](https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-dlss-indicator/) from PC Gamer to tweak the registry, or download [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/2045) that does it for you, that will enable an in-game DLSS Indicator which will show which version of DLSS is running. Should be version **DLSSv3 v310.3.0 / preset K** (it won't be version 4, as it seems to be Nvidia's marketing term rather than the actual DLL version).

2025-01-31,US Probing Whether DeepSeek Got Nvidia Chips Through Singapore,"> US officials are probing whether Chinese AI startup DeepSeek bought advanced Nvidia Corp. semiconductors through third parties in Singapore, circumventing US restrictions on sales of chips used for artificial intelligence tasks, people familiar with the matter said.

> Officials in the White House and Federal Bureau of Investigation are also trying to determine whether DeepSeek used intermediaries in the Southeast Asian nation to purchase Nvidia chips that the US has banned from sale to China, said the people, who requested anonymity to relay private conversations.

> Howard Lutnick, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Commerce Department, suggested on Wednesday that DeepSeek evaded US export controls. 

> “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around it, drive their DeepSeek model,” Lutnick, who would enforce semiconductor trade restrictions as the Commerce head, told senators in his confirmation hearing Wednesday. “It’s got to end. If they are going to compete with us, let them compete, but stop using our tools to compete with us. So I’m going to be very strong on that.”",954,269
2025-01-31,Nvidia’s Prime time to buy,"
Stocks are emotional in nature. The Nvidia incident is no different.

I understand why tech took a big hit, the idea that something just became even 20x cheaper is crazy new advancement and could be what makes AI very profitable and productive.

The nvidia stock going down I believe was an overreaction. One thing to consider is that yes you now don’t need the best chips, but you still need chips and you may need a lot more now that the price has become so much more attractive. 

Keep in mind as well nvidia over 10 years has increase the efficiency and power of the chip by 2-3x.

Now there might be a demand for maybe not the newest chips but one that can be mass produced. 

Nvidia owns 98percent of the chip market. This reaction should’ve only happened had they overnight lost their monopoly.

I believe it’s a great time to buy as of current being at 119. 

It’s impossible to predict if it’ll go up or down however I’m optimistic about Nvidia buy more than I was the past year. 

Another thing I will
Mention is when did we ever start blindly believe government funded projects like DeepSeek from China and how much it actually cost and how much time was actually spent. Many of these questions are still a mystery. Either way I don’t think it’s a bad thing for Us tech…it just means they get to copy that format and continue making innovations 

Pessimists will say ai bubble has bursted 

Optimism will get you into denial mindsets 

But looking at the data and picking it up for what I consider cheap for a good company is I think a good play 

I’ll likely sell when it hits 135 and rebounds after people pick up their hats.

2025-02-01,Do you think it's time to sell NVDA?,"The introduction of Deepseek probably doesn't warrant the sharp stock decline value of NVDA, that is understandable. But so is their stock value rise for the past 2 years. To put it in other words, yes the decline was a result of a hype, but so was the rise. Something that didn't make much sense got replaced by another thing that doesn't make much sense. At the end of the day, Nvidia is a great company that sells the best computer chips and GPU's, but that's all there is to it. I just don't see how they can rise again for the foreseeable future. They've hit a peak point in my opinion. And while Deepseek's introduction shouldn't have been the reason for their stock decline vlue, it was just a trigger for something that was in my opinion inevitable. 

I was pressured by family members into buying NVDA, and now the total loss is about 13.5% of its original price. I feel like I should just close the position as I just don't see how it can rise again for me to recoup the losses, but I also don't want to do something based on feelings. I hope someone in this subreddit can help. I try to do some due diligence and understand metrics, but I'm no expert and I'm finding it difficult to put the time into learning these things with my very demanding fulltime job, which is why I usually stick with  low risky ETF's, except for Nvidia which I was kinda pressured into buying, and I was worried that it might become even more profitable and then hearing ""I told you so!"".",0,67

2025-02-03,NVDA: DeepSeek’s Disruption and the Changing Tech Landscape,"* Nvidia’s AI Market Dominance – Nvidia’s H100 and H800 GPUs are essential for AI workloads, powering models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, with major tech firms like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon relying on its chips.
* DeepSeek’s Disruptive Impact – DeepSeek’s AI model V3, trained on Nvidia’s H800 chips at a fraction of the usual cost, raises questions about the necessity of high-cost AI hardware, pressuring Nvidia’s pricing power.
* Financial and Competitive Pressures – Nvidia depends heavily on a few major tech companies, faces emerging competition from AMD, Broadcom, and DeepSeek, and has a valuation significantly above industry norms, making it vulnerable to market corrections.
* Nvidia’s AI Market Dominance – Nvidia’s H100 and H800 GPUs are essential for AI workloads, powering models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, with major tech firms like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon relying on its chips.
* DeepSeek’s Disruptive Impact – DeepSeek’s AI model V3, trained on Nvidia’s H800 chips at a fraction of the usual cost, raises questions about the necessity of high-cost AI hardware, pressuring Nvidia’s pricing power.

Nvidia has established itself as a dominant force in the AI hardware industry, with its H100 and H800 chips powering some of the most advanced AI models, including ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The H100’s architecture enables AI models to train at unprecedented speeds, while the H800 variant meets regulatory requirements in markets like China. The evolution from the A100 to the H100 has significantly accelerated AI capabilities, with GPT-3 models learning four times faster than before. Nvidia’s market strength is reinforced by deep integration with tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, ensuring continued demand for its products. As AI models become more sophisticated and data-intensive, Nvidia’s GPUs remain central to pushing the limits of what AI can achieve.

DeepSeek’s AI model V3 has disrupted the industry by achieving high-performance AI training on Nvidia’s H800 chips at significantly lower costs. Traditionally, training advanced AI models has required billions in investment, but DeepSeek’s approach challenges this assumption, demonstrating that high-level AI training can be done with minimal resources. This efficiency could lead major tech firms to question Nvidia’s high pricing, pressuring the company’s ability to maintain its premium margins. If DeepSeek’s success encourages more companies to seek cost-effective alternatives, Nvidia may need to justify its premium pricing or risk losing market share.

Despite its strong position, Nvidia’s financial foundation has key vulnerabilities. Nearly half of its data center revenue comes from a handful of major tech firms, including Microsoft and Meta—companies that are now investing in developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. While Nvidia’s dominance in both software and hardware makes it difficult to replace, emerging competitors like AMD and DeepSeek are introducing cost-effective alternatives. DeepSeek, for example, trained its model with only $5 million, a fraction of the billions typically required for Nvidia-powered training. With a P/E ratio three times the industry average, Nvidia’s valuation remains highly sensitive to changes in AI spending and broader market trends. A slowdown in AI-related investments or increased competition could significantly impact Nvidia’s stock price.

For years, Nvidia was synonymous with AI growth, with investors believing that any advancement in AI would translate directly into gains for Nvidia. However, this perception is shifting. The emergence of cost-effective AI models and alternative chip suppliers, including DeepSeek, AMD, Google, and Amazon, challenges Nvidia’s “There Is No Alternative” (TINA) status. Concerns about pricing, licensing restrictions, and geopolitical factors, including U.S. government restrictions on chip exports, further complicate Nvidia’s outlook. Investors are increasingly questioning whether Nvidia can sustain its premium pricing in a market where competition is growing, leading to potential valuation recalibration.

The AI industry is undergoing rapid transformation, with cost-efficiency becoming a critical factor in decision-making. Nvidia’s high-end GPUs have long been the gold standard, but rising costs are prompting companies to explore alternatives. AMD’s MI300 series, for example, offers competitive AI processing power at lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for firms looking to diversify suppliers. Broadcom is also gaining traction in AI networking, while DeepSeek’s focus on affordable AI chips threatens Nvidia’s dominance. As these competitors gain market share, Nvidia’s ability to maintain its pricing power and market stronghold may diminish, forcing it to adapt to a changing landscape.

DeepSeek’s advancements have ripple effects across the AI supply chain. If AI training costs continue to drop, tech giants may slow down their AI-related capital expenditures, impacting Nvidia’s growth trajectory. Furthermore, the shift toward more cost-efficient AI solutions could reduce demand for Nvidia’s high-end chips, altering market priorities from premium performance to affordability. This evolving landscape presents both risks and opportunities for Nvidia. While it may face increased competition, Nvidia’s leadership in AI infrastructure and software solutions still gives it a competitive edge. However, it must adapt to changing market demands to sustain long-term growth.

Nvidia’s market dominance is being challenged as the AI industry evolves. The rise of DeepSeek, along with increased competition from AMD, Broadcom, and major tech firms developing in-house chips, raises concerns about Nvidia’s pricing power and long-term growth. Recent market shifts have already led to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia’s market value, the largest single-day loss in U.S. stock history.

If the AI market prioritizes efficiency over expansion, Nvidia could see reduced demand for its high-end GPUs. However, its history of innovation, strong AI infrastructure, and ongoing R&D investments position it well to adapt. While some analysts view recent market dips as a buying opportunity, the competitive pressures and changing industry dynamics mean Nvidia must continue evolving to maintain its leadership in AI hardware.

# TL;DR: Nvidia remains a dominant force in AI hardware, but emerging competitors like DeepSeek, AMD, and Broadcom are challenging its pricing power and market dominance. DeepSeek’s AI model demonstrates that high-performance AI training can be achieved at significantly lower costs, potentially reshaping the AI ecosystem. Nvidia’s dependence on a few tech giants and its high valuation make it vulnerable to market shifts, while increasing competition suggests that its long-term growth may face headwinds. However, Nvidia’s innovation and market leadership still offer strong potential, provided it adapts to the evolving AI landscape.

While it may face increased competition, Nvidia’s leadership in AI infrastructure and software solutions still gives it a competitive edge. However, it must adapt to changing market demands to sustain long-term growth.

Nvidia’s market dominance is being challenged as the AI industry evolves. The rise of DeepSeek, along with increased competition from AMD, Broadcom, and major tech firms developing in-house chips, raises concerns about Nvidia’s pricing power and long-term growth. Recent market shifts have already led to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia’s market value, the largest single-day loss in U.S. stock history.

If the AI market prioritizes efficiency over expansion, Nvidia could see reduced demand for its high-end GPUs. However, its history of innovation, strong AI infrastructure, and ongoing R&D investments position it well to adapt. While some analysts view recent market dips as a buying opportunity, the competitive pressures and changing industry dynamics mean Nvidia must continue evolving to maintain its leadership in AI hardware.

# TL;DR: Nvidia remains a dominant force in AI hardware, but emerging competitors like DeepSeek, AMD, and Broadcom are challenging its pricing power and market dominance. DeepSeek’s AI model demonstrates that high-performance AI training can be achieved at significantly lower costs, potentially reshaping the AI ecosystem. Nvidia’s dependence on a few tech giants and its high valuation make it vulnerable to market shifts, while increasing competition suggests that its long-term growth may face headwinds. However, Nvidia’s innovation and market leadership still offer strong potential, provided it adapts to the evolving AI landscape.",0,3
2025-02-03,Why Nvidia (most likely) won't meet the same fate as Cisco during the dotcom bubble,"Previous post was removed for not showing positions. I added them at the bottom.

Since Nvidia's stock price took a hit, I've been seeing a lot of posts and comments comparing Nvidia to Cisco during the peak of the dotcom bubble and claiming that this is where the AI bubble pops, so I decided to write this post to comparing the two companies, how they are different, and why using a sample size of 1 to predict a crash is as regarded as it gets.

This is written from the perspective of someone who worked in tech during the dotcom bubble (still do) and who had direct exposure to the crash. I will try to make it as consise and straight-to-the-point as possible since no one wants to read a book on a reddit post:

1. **Business model**: CSCO's business model was as bad as it gets. They were selling infrastructure hardware that could last you years with little to no need for upgrades. When infrastructure was build, the demand for CSCO's products slowed drastically. NVDA sells compute power, which will always be in demand as long as there's demand for AI, which isn't stopping anytime soon (see next 3 points for why).
2. **Demand**: CSCO's demand came primarily from tech startups with little to no cash (huge vulnerability) whereas NVDA's demand comes primarily from tech giants with more cash than god. Not to mention that CSCO's demand was cyclical and tied to the telecom industry, which was significantly smaller and less competitive than today's tech industry.
3. **Innovation**: Tech giants stand to lose a lot if they don't constantly innovate, which makes underinvesting in AI significantly riskier than overinvesting, as repeated by most big tech CEOs. If one of the tech giants drops out of the AI arms race and the others are able to innovate on it, that one company is done. Losing market share in this ultra-competitive market is as bad as it gets, and significantly worse than losing cash on an investment that might never pan out. The revenue to R&D budget percentage is nearly **triple** now compared to what it was during the dotcom bubble. This is why demand for top-of-the-line hardware will remain strong for the forseeable future.
4. **Moat and competition**: CSCO was overly concentrated on hardware, which opens the door for easy competition. NVDA's moat isn't their hardware, it's CUDA, which was being developed nearly a decade before any competitor even started to think about AI. This is what gave them a huge head-start (that is still nowhere close to being closed) and landed Nvidia where it is today. CUDA makes the costs of switching to a competitor's hardware too expensive to warrant doing so. As Jensen said: ""competition's hardware could be free and it would still be too expensive"".
5. **Ease of investing and PEs**: Higher PEs today can be justified with the fact that investing has become incredibly easier than it was back then and that US stocks have become much more international. Back then you had to phone your broker, pay significant fees sometimes ranging from $50 to $100 (which made growth investing/active trading a lot less appealing than it is today for retail investors) and mail in a check and paperwork. The whole process could take several days/weeks. Online accounts did exist, but they were very rare and payment was still done by mailing or dropping off checks for a while. Now anyone can fund an account and make a trade for next to nothing in fees in a single day **even internationally**. So the fact that CSCO was trading at a PE of 200 at it's peak tells you how absolutely insanely overvalued it was. NVDA is trading at a PE of 47. Peanuts in comparison.
6. **Growth prospects**: CSCO's growth was inflated by speculative demand whereas NVDA’s revenue is tied to measurable AI adoption (e.g., cloud giants spending billions on GPUs). People expected CSCO to grow based on their position in the market. NVDA has actual demand and revenue growth which is proven by TSMC's declared revenue and corraborated by countless giants.

**Bonus note: Why deepseek isn't bearish news for Nvidia** (Completely going under the assumption that they are legit, which seems less likely every day); I'm not going to keep repeating the same copy-paste that's been on this sub for the past few days (Jevons Paradox, more compute means more demands, etc). A lot of people's arguments are based under the impression that the end-goal for AI is to make a chatGPT. It isn't. And even if it was, do you really think that deepseek is the ultimate and final form of chatGPT? What deepseek has done is shown people that startups can compete with giants (at least in regards to LLMs). This means more competition and more GPU sales (even if lower-end). **Competition in AI application is as bullish as it gets for Nvidia**. Giants aren't going to stop buying top-of-the-line GPUs just because someone was able to make a chatGPT using less ressources. This literally makes no sense (refer to point #3 above).

Now I'm not completely discounting the possibility that NVDA might share a fate somewhat similar to CSCO's, but if AI really is a bubble that's going to eventually pop. It still has a long way to run based on the fundamentals and on the points discussed in this post. The upcoming earnings will be a testament to that fact.

**TL;DR**: Nvidia has a better sales model that strongly encourages additional spending and recurrent purchases (Cisco's didn't). Competition between Nvidia's clients is fiercer than Cisco's clients. Revenue to R&D capex ratio is higher than it ever was (triple the dotcom bubble's). Nvidia's moat is in it's software (CUDA), which was being developped long before any competitor even touched AI and makes it extremely difficult for competition to chip away at Nvidia's market dominance. Cisco was too concentrated on hardware which had really poor upgrade incentives and made competition very easy. Cisco's growth was highly speculative whereas Nvidia's growth is real and supported.

2025-02-06,Thinking about NVDA beyond 2025 Hyperscaler CapEx Growth,"With 3/4 hyperscalers reporting earnings already, the reaction to Nvidia has been positive, but stock still trades less than before DeepSeek. I believe the sentiment is that while 2025 will be great, Nvidia is nearing the ""end of great times"" and moving to a ""just good times"".

**Here's my take at a breakdown. I am not an expert, but have read a lot of positive and negative takes, I'm starting this thread to start a discussion not to pump the stock. Please don't comment ""Nvidia diamond hands durr"".** I didn't use AI to write this sadly.

I can't link out to some of the resources, but tried to describe them for easy search and find.

**TLDR:** Meeting 2025 revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far. It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand. Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them) - markets don't like that. However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.

**Disclosure:** Own a lot of NVDA. But have covered calls on them, so not a blindfold risktaker.

**Personal take:** NVDA is attractive at these levels, but I'd be cautious holding my entire position after the summer 2025 earnings calls from the hyperscalers, because if there's any indication there is a 2026 CapEx slowdown, stock could fall a lot. I can't predict the future, so diversification is important even if you like the stock.

However, continued chip innovation that maintains a competitive advantage that leads to higher end customer ROIs compared to other chip alternatives would help. Also, release of one tangible AI product would change the sentiment and game here (e.g. Robotaxis, enterprise solutions used common place for F500 companies, etc). Many are already underway - my company is releasing Gemini for all employees - this goes beyond software engineers. I think diversification across the industry (AVGO, TSM, power producers) could be valuable as time progresses as the AI use case boom happens.

\-----------------------------------------

**(1) Meeting 2025 Revenue projections isn't at excessive risk based on CapEx raises so far**

Based on [stockanalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/forecast/) consensus 2024 to 2025 revenue growth is estimated to be 52%.

1. MSFT: 55.7B in 2024 to 80B in 2025
2. Google: 52.5B in 2024 to 75B in 2025
3. Meta: 39B in 2024 to 60B - 60B in 2025

Based on the numbers written above, the anticipated growth from hyperscaler capex spend is 46% (if we assume concentration of NVDA chip spend as percent of capex steady). Hyperscalers are estimated to be about 50% of Nvidia revenue. To reach the 52% target that means from the remainder of the revenue book, Nvidia needs 58% spend increase.

This doesn't seem unreasonable. **Potential** investments through StarGate (Oracle), OpenAI's increasingly independent spending funded by Softbank, and sovereign AI investments are a tailwind to that figure. However, sustained export controls (e.g. Biden's global export framework) and increased crackdowns are headwinds.

**(2) It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand**

Based on multiple [sources](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-blackwell-gpus-are-sold-out-for-the-next-12-months-chipmaker-to-gain-market-share-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com), seems like Blackweel is sold out for the next 12 months anyways. So 2025 revenues may be a matter of strong production. Moreover, from the commentary that google had on their earnings call - seems like cloud growth is supply constrained by infrastructure rather than demand constrained. I believe for 2025 at least customers will buy as many NVIDIA chips as they can and its production that determines valuation.

Since the market is forward looking, 2025 revenue misses won't be as crucial as addressing the question of when is the demand going to slow down and the AI semiconductor sales from NVDA slowdown?

**(3) Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them)..markets don't like that**

No matter how you slice it, DeepSeek has provided true software driven advances that more efficiently use Nvidia GPUs and non-NVDA GPUs on the training and particularly inference level. You can look at the cost per inference token for DeepSeek vs. OpenAI. It has raised questions on the sustainability on needing cutting edge chips at high margins in the long run. Risks below.

* **Do closed loop models even have a moat over open source?**: Can closed-loop/proprietary LLMs develop models that demand a strong ROI justifying investment in more chips to **train** better models that **end users are willing to pay for**? Currently Sam Altman & Dario (Antropic) think compute is the way to go. However, at some point they could discover more compute for training =/= better or more efficient models.
* **Training:** Efficiencies in hardware utilization may reduce Nvidia's moat in interconnectivity and lead to better training advances, which could reduce margins if other chips are ""somewhat as good"" eventually given demand equalizes to supply. See point # 1 in this excellent recap here  (available by searching DeepSeek and the ramification on the AI industry: winners and losers? by Rihard Jarc)
* **More use cases in a post training world could mean more inference on custom chips & competitor products:** It is widely believed that Nvidia is more of an undisputed leader in training performance vs. inference. If open source models become good enough and training investments do not result in monetizable ROI, Nvidia's margins likely fall as custom chips and other semiconductor players provide good solutions. [Jevon's Paradox (more use cases and usage)](https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox) is very likely here, but volume would have to increase signficantly to offset margin decreases - a risk that the market doesn't like.
* **CUDA alternatives leads to market share loses?:** CUDA is widely known to be the best option ""coding"" platform to get GPUs to do what you want right now. [However, there are other applications coming out that allow fungible usage of other chips. ](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/17/nvidia_cuda_moat/#:~:text=If%20you're%20doing%20low,AMD%20hardware%20%E2%80%93%20and%20vice%20versa)This reduces the need to use Nvidia chips and pay such high margins. There's drawbacks to not using CUDA that I'll highlight in section 4.

Sidenote - there is an honest and excellent podcast on DeepSeek implications to Nvidia from Bankless w/ Jeffrey Emmanuel (whose blogpost got a lot of investors interested in DeepSeek impact over 2 weekends ago). Please listen.

**(4) However, uncertainity is an opportunity if Nvidia can deliver again - remember stocks climb a wall of worry.**

* **Early innings of the AI story:** Models are going to get more complex not stagnate. This requires more training compute as we try to reach AGI level models. On the inference front, as more use cases explode, there will be more general chip demand. We haven't even seen full released use cases in robotics, autonomous transit, healthcare AI, etc.
* **CUDA is the lowest latency** and provides best performance as of now. There might be a technical limit to how well alternatives perform.
* **Cost of being last** in AI is too great for hyperscalers
* **Continued innovation leadership:** Nvidia has expedited it's semiconductor cycle from 2 years to 1 year. Rubin (next gen AI chips) are already being worked on. Semiconductors are known to be cylical, but this may dull any trough cycle.
* **Increased soverign AI investments** (StarGate, Middle east, etc.)
* **Ridiculous cash flow with minimal R&D** as % of revenue means that Nvidia can invest in strategic ventures, emerging tech, and adjacent spaces to diversify revenue streams. Not sure this is proven out in the financials yet, but could in the future.
* **Hopefully - reduced interest rates boosts stock valuations**.

2025-02-10,Why Estimates For NVIDIA's Q4 Revenue Could Be Dead Wrong: The Case for NVIDIA's Next Blowout Report,"TL;DR: Estimating NVIDIA's Q4 FY2025\* revenue from the capex of its four largest customers using linear regression results in an estimated revenue that is significantly higher than Wall Street's expectations.

*\*Note: Although it may sound confusing, NVIDIA is in fiscal year 2025 and will report its* [*Q4 FY2025 results on February 26, 2025*](https://investor.nvidia.com/events-and-presentations/events-and-presentations/default.aspx)*.*

*This is the author’s opinion only, not financial advice, and is intended for entertainment purposes only. The author holds a beneficial long position in NVIDIA Corporation. The author receives no compensation for writing this article and has no business relationship with any of the companies mentioned. The following analysis has been carefully conducted, but numbers or calculations may be incorrect, leading to potentially incorrect results.*

NVIDIA will report its Q4 FY2025 financial results on February 26. The consensus estimate for NVIDIA's Q4 revenue is [$38.13 billion](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/analysis/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANOTJUpcAKXWdLKLCN4HDOw3xKM2mpDinXbx-3Ru72Xm5RtzQ8Qf0ruVaAPw61jJOwPbZHkqX9X2SRQvZJqafxEFMyTmQoFXdmxWLKJ-26YBEwQoOy5EcgpCEHOlmOzeyyZXGeSD-90RiaVAj_H8nFt0DtbA37mKFQUC-eGlN5tA). In the past two weeks, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, NVIDIA's largest customers, have reported earnings. [One of the biggest headlines](https://www.ft.com/content/634b7ec5-10c3-44d3-ae49-2a5b9ad566fa) was the announcement that these four companies plan to spend approximately $320 billion in capital expenditures (capex) through 2025:

|Year|Meta|Alphabet|Microsoft|Amazon|Sum|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2024 ($bn)|39.2|52.6|75.6|77.8|245.2|
|2025 (planned, $bn)|65.0|75.0|80.0|100.0|320.0|

Much less attention was paid to the significant increase in capital expenditures by these companies last quarter:

|Category|Meta|Alphabet|Microsoft|Amazon|Sum|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Last quarter reported ($bn)|14.425|14.276|15.804|27.834|72.339|
|Previous quarter ($bn)|8.258|13.061|14.923|22.620|58.862|
|Change from previous quarter|\+74.7%|\+9.3%|\+5.9%|\+23.1%|\+22.90%|

Since these 4 companies are the largest buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs, it makes sense to examine a correlation between these companies' quarterly capex and NVIDIA's quarterly revenue. For the last 7 quarters, we get a strong correlation coefficient of 0.95 (Pearson correlation). Now, if we use linear regression to estimate NVIDIA's revenue for the yet-to-be-reported Q4 2025 based on this data, we get quarterly revenue of $49.265 billion, which is more than $10 billion above the consensus analyst estimate.

https://preview.redd.it/fuwtgc4iv9ie1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=477315081203fddfa64c4744f2429c371c4a8041

Of course, NVIDIA's GPUs account for only a portion of these 4 companies' reported capex. However, given the recent disappointing results from NVIDIA's competitor AMD, that portion may have increased. It could also be that a lot of datacenters have been built now and these costs were already incurred in previous quarters, leaving more capex for NVIDIA's GPUs - and the newly built datacenters should now have plenty of room for the upcoming Blackwell generation. Of course, companies like Alphabet are also building their own AI chips, but they are much less cost-effective than NVIDIA's Hopper generation and especially the upcoming Blackwell generation. Or as [Amazon CEO Andy Jassy put it on an analyst call last week](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-price-87ccceac?mod=RTA): ""*most AI compute has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future.*"" All in all, one could assume that the share of capex from these 4 companies going to NVIDIA may have even increased in the last quarter.

In addition, there are other major buyers of NVIDIA's GPUs: xAI, for example, has also purchased tens of thousands of NVIDIA's GPUs and built the massive supercomputer [Colossus with 100,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/spectrum-x-ethernet-networking-xai-colossus). Another massive buyer of NVIDIA's GPUs has just formed with Project Stargate, which plans to invest a staggering [$500 billion in new AI infrastructure](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/) over the next four years. All of this should continue to be a strong wind in NVIDIA's sails.

My positions: 200 NVIDIA shares.

2025-02-12,Post your 50 series core clock curves and results here!,"Hey all,

  Figured with all the talk about burning power cables I'd post about my undervolting endeavors for the 5090.  

  Managed to grab a 5090 FE by pure chance.  The main thing I've seen on undervolting this card was from this post and referenced video:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1i8emnz/rtx\_5090\_undervolting\_results\_6\_at\_400w/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1i8emnz/rtx_5090_undervolting_results_6_at_400w/)

  I've been able to run about 100 to 150 watts lower and lose only 2 to 3.5 percent in performance.  My thermals are a good 12 to 15 degrees cooler at max load.  CP77 is one of the biggest deltas in performance, so I have posted the undervolted/curve result and stock, along with the curve that ultimately worked.

  How did I determine that curve?  No friggin' idea.  I tried a solid 50 that looked almost identical to this one but this just ran 50 watts lower and performed better than the rest.  I think the 5090 FE is more finicky than it's predecessor on specific values that produce results.

First set is stock, second is undervolt.

Anyone get some good curves they can post?  Either undervolting or OCing?  5080 included?

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

So my brother is shorting nvidia stock but I conversely hold nvidia stock and I am predicting/hoping it will go up in price. When I asked him this and asked for more detail this is what he responded with:



1-He states that it is price valuation has ballooned way too quickly and is a bubble. So there will be a massive correction.



2-He states that they only really do graphics cards and software and with such a narrow market focus it makes no sense why they are the world's second most valuable company.



3-He states that ai technology is overhyped and it has reached the top of its s-curve.



4-He states that would be hard to improve the hardware without a breakthrough from quantum computing which will take quite a few years.



5-He states that most modern gamers now prefer older games and indie games.



6-He states that most modern gamers only care about good graphics to a point and the artstyle/design is what truly makes a game look good.



7 -He states the CEO (Jenson Huang) is pretentious and disconnected from reality.



So what should I respond to him with or do you think he is right. Just asking for some honest advice.

**Update - February 25**

**NVIDIA's Response Below**:

>*“Upon further investigation, we’ve identified that an* ***early production build of GeForce RTX 5080 GPUs were also affected by the same issue***\*.\* ***Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement***\*,” Nvidia GeForce global PR director Ben Berraondo tells The Verge.\*

>*In response to The Verge’s questions, Berraondo adds that “****no other Nvidia GPUs have been affected” — we specifically asked about the upcoming RTX 5070, and he says it’s not affected either. Nor should any cards be affected that were produced more recently: “The production anomaly has been corrected,” he says****. In case you’re wondering, he also told us that* ***Nvidia was not aware of these issues before it launched these GPUs.***

**Here's NVIDIA's Full Amended Statement**:

>*We have identified a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D, RTX 5080, and 5070 Ti GPUs which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement. The production anomaly has been corrected.*

**NVIDIA's Response Below**:

>*Nvidia GeForce global PR director Ben Berraondo tells The Verge*:

>*We have identified* ***a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D and 5070 Ti GPUs*** *which have one fewer ROP than specified.

\-------------------

**Quick Clarification from me:**

In the response above, NVIDIA mentioned ""one fewer ROP"". In this case, they are referring to the Raster Operation partition. One (1) Raster Operation partition contains the eight (8) missing ROP units.

Also, if you want to check your 50 Series cards with [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/), below is the **correct** ROPs amounts from [Blackwell whitepaper](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/blackwell/nvidia-rtx-blackwell-gpu-architecture.pdf):

* **RTX 5090** = 176 ROPs (Affected units have 168 ROPs)
* **RTX 5080 =** 112 ROPs (Affected units have 104 ROPs)
* **RTX 5070 Ti** = 96 ROPs (Affected units have 88 ROPs)

We have also seen [someone](https://reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1iwi18d/rtx_5080_missing_rops/) with 8 missing ROPs on his RTX 5080 as well. While the statement from NVIDIA did not mention RTX 5080, if you do have the same issue with any of the 50 Series cards, the path forward is the same and it is to **contact board manufacturers and** **RMA the card**",972,694

Earnings on Wednesday should be very interesting. Here’s a consolidated copy

Super Micro Lowers FY25 Revenue Guide, Pushes Back 30% Liquid Cooling Target


Super Micro recently reported preliminary fiscal Q2 results, in which it cut its fiscal 2025 revenue guide while hinting that Blackwell GPUs could take longer to ramp in the first part of the calendar year.

At Computex in June 2024, CEO Charles Liang stated that he “expects 15 percent of racks [SMCI] sells this year to use DLC, and 30 percent to employ it [in 2025].” In August 2024,  Liang slightly changed his tune, noting that they now expect “25% to 30% of the new global datacenter deployments to use DLC solutions in the next 12 months.”

I remember this comment well, as it was part of the evidence used to debunk the August rumors considering SMCI had moved up their timeline for DLC delivery (from end of year 2025 to mid-year 2025).

Two weeks ago in the February 2025 report, this timeline was shifted back with Liang stating that Super Micro now believes that “DLC or overall liquid cooling market share will grow all the way to 30% or even more in the next 12 months” -- it’s not a dramatic shift in tone but rather pushes the 30% target back from mid-year 2025 noted in August, to beyond the original year-end timeline --- to now technically being early 2026.

The August earnings call also housed one critical piece of information regarding Blackwell and Super Micro’s 2025 revenue. Wells Fargo’s Aaron Rakers questioned management about Blackwell and guidance for December 2024 and onwards. Liang explained that for the December quarter, Blackwell “will be very small. Engineering sample small volume. So the real volume, I believe, had to be March quarter next year. And that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion.”

But now, SMCI implied they are not able to ship Blackwell in the March quarter:

Super Micro has walked back the revenue guide that hinged on Blackwell’s NVL systems shipping in volume in the March quarter. Management was also quite clear that the new product was facing a delay as they await more GPU supply.

Vertiv is a provider of thermal and power management solutions and is a leader in direct liquid cooling. The company stated they benefited from a “particularly strong” Q4, with revenue rising nearly 26% YoY as they overdelivered by nearly $200 million as customers wanted products as soon as possible.

Vertiv’s strength in Q4 may be tied to key partner Dell, as its AI server backlog in fiscal Q3 (October quarter) rose more than 18% QoQ to $4.5 billion after being flat QoQ in Q2, and its AI pipeline rising more than 50% QoQ. Analysts placed Dell’s AI server pipeline at $16 to $17 billion, up from $11 to $13 billion previously, a rather large jump for one quarter. However, Dell noted that one factor for its softer Q4 and fiscal year guide was the “unpredictability of the AI shipments” as there are “some more timing differences than what we were anticipating when we gave the guide the last quarter.”

For Q1, Vertiv guided a deceleration to 19% YoY growth, with FY25 revenue growth guided at 16%. Management defended this deceleration into Q1 by saying: “Now of course, Q4 was particularly strong. So we should not look at Q1 as a quarter-to-quarter, really look at the first quarter sales as the acceleration that has taken place. With a 19% organic growth in the first quarter, I feel very, very good about what that tells us about our overall trajectory” and also that it is “higher than what we actually saw in 2024.”

Liquid cooling capacity is not a constraint for Vertiv, as they had said last summer that they were “on track to finish in 2024 with a 45x capacity increase compared to baseline at the end of 2023.”

I agree with the analyst sentiment (and weak price action) following the report that the commentary doesn’t check out exactly. management is contradicting itself by guiding for organic growth of 19% at the midpoint for Q1 but 16% growth for the fiscal year (i.e., slower growth later in the year) while stating shipments will increase QoQ.

Additionally, the QoQ/YoY has to be looked at which is lower than what typical seasonality would account for, as our numbers indicate Vertiv was down (12.1%) due to seasonal sequential growth from Q4-Q1. This year, Vertiv is down (16.9%) from Q4-Q1.

My conclusion (still to be confirmed) is that Vertiv may see a weak Q2 before there is an acceleration into the back half.


Networking Companies Shift Tone on Timing for GB200s


PCIe 6.0 supplier:

PCIe 6.0 is a networking standard expected to initially ship with Nvidia’s Blackwell. A key supplier stated to expect this in the second half of the year, as these products “are driving higher dollar content opportunities [...] on a full rack and full accelerator basis and we expect volume deployments to begin in the second half of this year.”

Revealed at GTC in March of 2024, PCIe 6.0 was initially expected to launch with the GB200s. The following quote from this supplier also hints that merchant GPUs (Nvidia) will not be driving H1 – which would be odd if Blackwell was shipping. “Now, if you look into 2025, we see both contributing growth. The first half of the year will be more predominantly the internal AI accelerator programs. But if you get into the back half of the year, the transition on the merchant GPUs will also be very strong for us. This is where you'll see the custom rack configurations start to deploy and that’s where we see a big dollar increase in our contemporary GPU with [our product] starting to ramp.”

PMIC Suppliers:

PMICs (power management integrated circuits) are a critical part of the picture for Blackwell, given that these components were linked to Blackwell’s rumored power management issues. Major PMIC suppliers were unable to confirm volume shipments in the first quarter in recent earnings calls.

One PMIC supplier that we covered on our Advanced site on Feb 5th, is stating that “We know that we're not the only one players going after this, so the share is still to be determined. The final design, everything is still to be finalized as well, too. So we're working closely with the customer. Again, at this point, we can say that we're targeting for a mid-year launch.”

This company is either discussing Blackwell Ultra with the B300s, or they are implying GB200s are delayed.

The competing PMIC supplier stated: “Just to add a little bit of color to how we see the year rolling out, we believe that we will be off to a slower start in the first half of the year. But as the year develops, the customer base is expected to broaden as hyperscalers launch their new products. We have multiple product ramps with both existing customers as well as with these new hyperscalers.”

The takeaway is that neither PMIC supplier can confirm they are shipping in volume in Q1 or Q2, yet meanwhile, both are saying they are still part of the supply chain.

Semtech Suddenly Pulls Guidance on Active Copper Cabling (ACCs)


Perhaps the most drastic commentary to come out of the last few weeks was when a key supplier pulled its Q1 guidance intra-quarter.

Semtech filed an 8-K stating that “net sales from its CopperEdge products used in active copper cables are expected to be lower than the Company’s previously disclosed floor case estimate of $50 million due to rack architecture changes, with no expected ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026.”

ACC content had been estimated to be substantially higher with 36x2 configurations – it had been rumored back in October 2024 that Nvidia was halting development of one of the NVL72 configurations, the NVL36x2, which linked two 36 GPU racks together in a side-by-side system. Semtech pulling guidance strengthens this view.

The shift in architecture to discontinue the 36x2 configuration was said to possibly “disrupt the supply chain for assembly and cooling solutions,” by removing dual-rack configurations and focusing solely on single-rack NVL72 and NVL36 configurations. DLC suppliers have been pushing back Blackwell’s ramp later in the year, suggesting that the market may have faced some impacts from this rumored design change late last year.

While shifting architectures is not a big deal in the medium-term (as stated above, NVL72 single rack configurations are expected to see a higher mix); it’s the suddenness that Semtech pulled it’s guidance that is cause for concern as the company had reaffirmed its optimistic revenue floor guidance  based on two factors – the timing of Blackwell’s launch and changes in rack design. This suggests both factors may be in play, as a late-stage design change was expected to have downstream impacts on timing for DLC ramping.

Conclusion:
Given market jitters around DeepSeek, which turned out to be a non-issue, something more material related to the GB200s, such as growth slowing below expectations at the start of the new fiscal year, could send the stock below $100 -- which we would see as a buying opportunity.

There is a scenario where Nvidia’s stock marches higher – perhaps based on the remaining strength from Hopper and the B200s, B200 HGX systems and B200As packaged with CoWoS-S and having a lower thermal design power (TDP). Or perhaps the string of suppliers discussed here are simply stating the GB200s are not ramping in volume in Q1 but will in Q2.",131,52

More interesting is enthusiasts and the lucky few that got the cards but now deal with ""the missing ROP"" are saying NVDIA is downplaying the damage or the performance loss to the cards by 8 to 1. 

Looks like cut cost to maximize profit.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

2025-03-03,Will US-Ukraine Split will trigger Chinese invasion of Taiwan (TSM/NVDA related),"There's at least two possibilities: 

* Our divestment from Ukraine will give us more resources to deal with China militarily; or
* We're actually signaling to China that we are not interested in defending other countries.

Chinese invasion of Taiwan is always on the table, but some people think what happened on Friday at the White House has just raised that possibility dramatically.

For example, Cramer wrote an article over the weekend for his paid community where he said: 

* ""If I was Chinese President Xi Jinping, I would immediately move militarily on Taiwan, betting that President Trump may switch sides and back China.""

* ""If you disagree with that after Friday’s White House exchange with Zelenskyy, you need to soul search your position. To me, this could be a tremendous opportunity for the PRC to stop this whole game of export restrictions from the U.S. and just turn everything on its head by taking over the island and, along with it, the most important strategic asset in the world right now, Taiwan Semi.""

* ""In a world where Zelenskyy gets thrown under the bus for lack of gratitude and starting a war that he didn’t start, how can we defend an allegedly ungrateful Taiwan? Perhaps because, unlike Ukraine, there is something at stake economically?""

* ""Will President Trump’s advisers discuss the notion that if we care about keeping the Chinese from getting the latest and greatest Nvidia chips, we should care about Taiwan’s sovereignty? Will Trump be persuaded by even cowed generals and naïve national security advisers that Nvidia and Taiwan Semi are of strategic importance? Do they even know that?""

Of course Cramer is an entertainer and not a military strategist. But I'm curious what does the community think. Is the American handling of Ukraine increasing or decreasing China's resolve to invade Taiwan soon? Would you change your investment strategy based on your analysis?",151,269

Huawei’s revenue exceeded 860 billion yuan ($118.27 billion) in 2024, state media reported, [a 22% jump in revenue from 2023](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/06/china-huawei-revenue-surges-despite-us-sanctions.html), and the fastest growth since a 32% increase in 2016, according to CNBC calculations of publicly released figures.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

2025-03-12,"TSMC pitched Intel foundry JV to Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom","TSMC (2330.TW), has pitched U.S. chip designers Nvidia (NVDA.O),, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), and Broadcom (AVGO.O), about taking stakes in a joint venture that would operate Intel's (INTC.O), factories, according to four sources familiar with the matter.

Under the proposal, the Taiwanese chipmaking giant would run the operations of Intel's foundry division, which makes chips adapted for the needs of customers, but it would not own more than 50%, the sources said. Qualcomm (QCOM.O), has also been pitched by TSMC, according to one of the sources and a separate source.

The talks, which are at an early stage, come after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration requested TSMC, the world's leading contract chipmaker, assist in turning around the troubled U.S. industrial icon, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.

The details of the plan for TSMC to take no more than a 50% stake and its overtures to potential partners are being reported for the first time.

Any final deal - the value of which is unclear - would need approval from the Trump administration, which does not want Intel or its foundry division to be fully foreign-owned, the sources said.

Intel, TSMC, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm declined to comment. The White House and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.

At stake is the future of the U.S. chipmaking giant, whose shares have lost more than half of their value in the last year.

Intel reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986, driven by large impairments. The foundry division's property and plant equipment had a book value of $108 billion as of December 31, according to a company filing.

Intel stock rose more than 7% in premarket U.S. trading on Wednesday, while Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm were up between 0.8% and 1.5%. TSMC closed about 1.8% higher in Taiwan.

Trump is keen to revive Intel's fortunes, as he seeks to boost American advanced manufacturing, three of the sources said.

The sources said TSMC's joint venture pitch was made to potential backers before the Taiwanese chipmaker announced with Trump on March 3 that the company planned to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that involves building five additional chip facilities there in coming years.

Talks about the joint venture over Intel's foundry division have since continued, the three sources said, with TSMC looking to have more than one chip designer as a partner.

Multiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division.

Qualcomm has exited earlier discussions to buy all or part of Intel, according to those people and a separate source.

Intel board members have backed a deal and held negotiations with TSMC, while some executives are firmly opposed, according to two sources.

Intel's contract manufacturing business, or foundry division, was a crucial part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to save Intel. Gelsinger was forced out by the board in December, which named two interim co-CEOs who have mothballed its forthcoming AI chip.

Any deals between historical rivals TSMC and Intel would face major challenges and be costly and laborious. The two companies currently use vastly different processes, chemicals, and chipmaking tool setups at their factories, according to separate sources at the companies.

Intel has previously had manufacturing partnerships with Taiwan's UMC (2303.TW), and Israel's Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA), that could offer a precedent for the two companies to operate together, but it remains unclear how such a partnership would work regarding trade manufacturing secrets.

The Taiwanese chipmaker wants potential investors in the joint venture to also be Intel advanced manufacturing customers, according to one of the sources.

Reuters reported last week, citing sources, that Nvidia and Broadcom are running manufacturing tests with Intel, using the company's most advanced production techniques, known as 18A. AMD is also evaluating whether Intel's 18A manufacturing process is suitable for it.

But 18A has been an area of contention in negotiations between Intel and TSMC, two sources said. During talks in February, Intel executives told TSMC that its advanced 18A manufacturing technology was superior to TSMC's 2-nanometer process, according to those sources.

In their latest earnings call, while they had revenue from research collaborations, both IONQ and RGTI do not have a commercially viable product, nor do they even have a realistic timeline to one. Both claim, maybe 2030...and quantum computers have always been ""5 more years!""

Some facts - The RGTI CEO is focused on fidelity - improving accuracy a projected 2x this year! To be commercially viable ""like an NVIDIA GPU"" requires 100,000,000 X accuracy gains...

Quantum Advantage is not a given at lower fidelity rates either.

The commercial TAMS they claim Quantum will help are not limited by compute (drug discovery, networking, crypto, NFTs, AI, etc.)

And now we get to the event coming up; NVIDIA's Quantum Day.

These stocks went into free fall when Jensen and Zuckerberg admitted quantum tech is many decades out from relevance.

Jensen then saved them by stating he was going to host quantum day; MSFT the same day announced for companies to be ""quantum ready for 2025!"" in a blog post.

We have to ask ourselves why? And what is happening at quantum day?

The WHY behind NVDA and MSFT is simple - right after this hype marketing on quantum, MSFT reported dissapointing cloud sales to enterprise. MSFT cap-ex on NVIDIA GPUS is dependent on these units sales. MSFT offers the ability to play around with these quantum computers on their cloud for research purposes - though they are typically down and worthless but they do consume a TON of compute.

This not only marked the top of the market because why would MSFT and NVDA need to pump quantum if AI is going HAM? It's an act of desperation by their marketing teams, simple as.

Finally the coup de grace - QUANTUM DAY (RED WEDDING)

Who is the guest on the same level as NVDA? Crowdstrike. Why? Because the only real application for quantum computers long term is encryption breaking...important for security. The only issue here is; Crowdstrike is invested in avoiding that for their customers so they will DEFINITELY outline how they will invalidate this technology.

When the market realizes the only potential use for quantum in decades will be invalidated by tech from players like CRWD, its a headshot.

To add insult to injury, IONQ's CEO who is attending the NVDIA conference has been comparing themselves to 2015 NVIDIA...claiming Jensen is afraid of them...lol

This CEO is a serial SPACer and midwit.

Enjoy shorting this or buy puts. I think all will work out. Not financial advice. Maybe buy some short term calls to hedge.

> Announced at GTC 2025, the model, dubbed Groot N1, is a “generalist” model — trained on synthetic data and real data. Nvidia said that Groot N1 features a “dual system architecture” for “thinking fast and slow,” inspired by human cognitive processes.
> 
> Groot N1’s slow thinking system lets a robot perceive and reason about its environment and instructions and then plan the right actions to take, according to Nvidia. As for the fast thinking system, it translates the aforementioned plan into robotic actions, including the ability to manipulate objects and execute multi-step sequences.
> 
> The model is available in open source, Nvidia said. Alongside the model, Nvidia is releasing simulation frameworks and blueprints for generating synthetic training data. ([Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/nvidia-announces-groot-n1-a-foundation-model-for-humanoid-robotics/))

What is the implication of this for Nvdia and other robotics-driven stocks like Tesla and the growing Chinese challengers like BYD and Xpeng?",49,2
2025-03-19,"Nvidia, GM announce deal for AI, factories and next-gen vehicles","General Motors and Nvidia have agreed to a strategic collaboration that includes the automaker using several products and artificial intelligence services from the tech giant for its next-generation vehicles, advanced driver-assistance systems and factories.

The companies on Tuesday announced that the new initiatives include building custom artificial intelligence systems using Nvidia compute platforms, including “Omniverse with Cosmos,” for optimizing GM’s factory planning and robotics.

The Detroit automaker also said it will use “Nvidia Drive AGX” for “in-vehicle hardware for future advanced driver-assistance systems and in-cabin enhanced safety driving experiences.”

GM declined to disclose a cost for the new tools with Nvidia. The tech company has been attempting to diversify its automotive business, which has notably included substantial work in data centers and GPUs.

“The era of physical AI is here, and together with GM, we’re transforming transportation, from vehicles to the factories where they’re made,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia founder and CEO, said in a release. “We are thrilled to partner with GM to build AI systems tailored to their vision, craft and know-how.”

GM has been using Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, for training AI models across various areas of its business, including simulation and validation. The new business expands to in-vehicle hardware, automotive plant design and operations, the companies said.

The automaker also had been testing Nvidia’s Omniverse since at least 2022. Some of GM’s testing was in designing a “digital twin,” or replica, of its new design center and processes to assist virtual vehicle development. It also acted as a single digital environment for employees to work and collaborate in, according to a video last year featuring GM for Nvidia’s GTC developer conference in 2023.

Nvidia anticipated it would strike a deal with GM mid-last year for Omniverse, according to an internal company email viewed by CNBC. At that time, two sources with GM signaled the automaker wasn’t sure Nvidia’s software and GPUs were worth the high cost compared with other companies.

It wasn’t immediately clear what sealed the deal for GM. But since that time, both companies have experienced increased competition from China and uncertain regulatory changes such as tariffs. GM’s stock is off roughly 8% during in 2025, while Nvidia is off about 12% this year.

“AI not only optimizes manufacturing processes and accelerates virtual testing but also helps us build smarter vehicles while empowering our workforce to focus on craftsmanship,” GM CEO Mary Barra said in Nvidia’s release. “By merging technology with human ingenuity, we unlock new levels of innovation in vehicle manufacturing and beyond.”

The companies announced the new initiatives in connection with Nvidia’s GTC AI conference this week in California.

Nvidia describes Omniverse as a platform for “developing and deploying physically based industrial digitalization applications.” It’s essentially connecting a physical environment with a digital, or software, world to optimize processes using a “digital twin” of a physical environment such as a GM design facility or plant.

Users of Nvidia’s Omniverse have included BMW, Amazon Robotics and Samsung, Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology, said during a media briefing a year ago. He said the company was licensing Omniverse for $4,500 per GPU, per year.

It’s unclear how many GPUs GM will need. But given the amount of robotics, sensors and other systems needed to operate a modern assembly plant, it would likely be quite a bit.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

2025-03-20,NVDA: Groot N1 our foundation model for humanoid robots will be open source,"It was announced on stage as the last big news of Jensen's presentation.

>Nvidia is releasing what it’s calling an AI foundation model for humanoid robotics.

> Announced at GTC 2025, the model, dubbed Groot N1, is a “generalist” model — trained on synthetic data and real data. Nvidia said that Groot N1 features a “dual system architecture” for “thinking fast and slow,” inspired by human cognitive processes.
> 
> Groot N1’s slow thinking system lets a robot perceive and reason about its environment and instructions and then plan the right actions to take, according to Nvidia. As for the fast thinking system, it translates the aforementioned plan into robotic actions, including the ability to manipulate objects and execute multi-step sequences.
> 
> The model is available in open source, Nvidia said. Alongside the model, Nvidia is releasing simulation frameworks and blueprints for generating synthetic training data. ([Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/nvidia-announces-groot-n1-a-foundation-model-for-humanoid-robotics/))

What is the implication of this for Nvdia and other robotics-driven stocks like Tesla and the growing Chinese challengers like BYD and Xpeng?",49,2
2025-03-20,"Nvidia, GM announce deal for AI, factories and next-gen vehicles","General Motors and Nvidia have agreed to a strategic collaboration that includes the automaker using several products and artificial intelligence services from the tech giant for its next-generation vehicles, advanced driver-assistance systems and factories.

The companies on Tuesday announced that the new initiatives include building custom artificial intelligence systems using Nvidia compute platforms, including “Omniverse with Cosmos,” for optimizing GM’s factory planning and robotics.

The Detroit automaker also said it will use “Nvidia Drive AGX” for “in-vehicle hardware for future advanced driver-assistance systems and in-cabin enhanced safety driving experiences.”

GM declined to disclose a cost for the new tools with Nvidia. The tech company has been attempting to diversify its automotive business, which has notably included substantial work in data centers and GPUs.

“The era of physical AI is here, and together with GM, we’re transforming transportation, from vehicles to the factories where they’re made,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia founder and CEO, said in a release. “We are thrilled to partner with GM to build AI systems tailored to their vision, craft and know-how.”

GM has been using Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, for training AI models across various areas of its business, including simulation and validation. The new business expands to in-vehicle hardware, automotive plant design and operations, the companies said.

The automaker also had been testing Nvidia’s Omniverse since at least 2022. Some of GM’s testing was in designing a “digital twin,” or replica, of its new design center and processes to assist virtual vehicle development. It also acted as a single digital environment for employees to work and collaborate in, according to a video last year featuring GM for Nvidia’s GTC developer conference in 2023.

Nvidia anticipated it would strike a deal with GM mid-last year for Omniverse, according to an internal company email viewed by CNBC. At that time, two sources with GM signaled the automaker wasn’t sure Nvidia’s software and GPUs were worth the high cost compared with other companies.

It wasn’t immediately clear what sealed the deal for GM. But since that time, both companies have experienced increased competition from China and uncertain regulatory changes such as tariffs. GM’s stock is off roughly 8% during in 2025, while Nvidia is off about 12% this year.

“AI not only optimizes manufacturing processes and accelerates virtual testing but also helps us build smarter vehicles while empowering our workforce to focus on craftsmanship,” GM CEO Mary Barra said in Nvidia’s release. “By merging technology with human ingenuity, we unlock new levels of innovation in vehicle manufacturing and beyond.”

The companies announced the new initiatives in connection with Nvidia’s GTC AI conference this week in California.

Nvidia describes Omniverse as a platform for “developing and deploying physically based industrial digitalization applications.” It’s essentially connecting a physical environment with a digital, or software, world to optimize processes using a “digital twin” of a physical environment such as a GM design facility or plant.

Users of Nvidia’s Omniverse have included BMW, Amazon Robotics and Samsung, Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology, said during a media briefing a year ago. He said the company was licensing Omniverse for $4,500 per GPU, per year.

It’s unclear how many GPUs GM will need. But given the amount of robotics, sensors and other systems needed to operate a modern assembly plant, it would likely be quite a bit.

More than 20 other automakers have used Nvidia’s “system on a chip” hardware in the central computing units of their smart vehicles, including Mercedes Benz, Volvo, Audi, Volkswagen and BYD, according to an industry equity research note from Jeffries in November 2023.

In recent years, Nvidia has seen soaring demand for its GPUs, which are used for everything from bitcoin mining to AI inference and training.

2025-03-21,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

News: [London's Heathrow Airport Shut Friday Due To Power Outage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/london-s-heathrow-airport-shut-friday-due-to-power-outage)

Overall, mainly earnings today.

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d) \- EPS of $0.54 vs. $0.30 expected. Revenue of $11.3B vs. $11.02B expected. Despite beating expectations, sales/profits declined YoY in NA/China/Online.

2025-03-22,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

This is getting ridiculous, it has been several months now and this issue still has not been fixed, as far as I can tell it started with the 572.xx driver. Spending AU$1500 on a graphics card and then having it not work properly within 1 year (or be locked out of certain games because I am not using the latest drivers) is unacceptable. Rolling back to 566.36 drivers fixes the issue for me, but then I am locked out of certain games (e.g. Half Life 2 RTX) and newer features, which will become worse over time.

2025-03-25,Got into Priority Access. Purchased 5090. Product damaged in shipping and FedEx returned back to Nvidia. ORDER CANCELLED AND REFUNDED WITH NO OPTION TO RE-BUY.,"UPDATE 4: It seems that Nvidia is properly addressing the specific issue I encountered as described below for anyone else who is dealing with it. Mine seems to be an edge case. The more systemic issue appears to be credit card fraud prevention declining peoples' purchases and not providing them with an opportunity to rectify this while returning their already-in-transit GPUs to the sender and not providing the buyer with any opportunity to get back into the Verified Priority Access program. It doesn't have to be like this and Nvidia should seriously consider changing their purchasing process so that this doesn't happen anymore. It can't be cheap for them to ship GPUs out only to pull them back at the last minute.

UPDATE 3: Received my replacement 5090 from Nvidia and all is well. Again, if you somehow encounter a similar issue and your payment has successfully gone through, just make sure to open a support ticket both at Nvidia Marketplace as well as at the normal Nvidia support site, that seems to be what saved me here.

UPDATE 2: Just got off the phone with an escalation manager. He had been aware of my issue for some time and just waited for my refund to process before reaching out. Told me this was the first time he was aware of a situation like mine where FedEx sent back a GPU to them due to damage that they had shipped to a customer and that he'd be happy to process a new order for me. Order was processed and shipped out via overnight, I should have it tomorrow. Told him the support communication was not great up until that point and blamed Digital River but apparently Nvidia does all this marketplace stuff in house now and doesn't deal with them at all, and their support staff is still gathering their bearings. So if you have a similar situation and have a ticket open, just know they do actually look at these things. One thing I'd suggest is to open not only a ticket with the Marketplace support, but also through the main Nvidia Customer Care department and do everything you can to get an escalation.

Thanks to the Customer Care department for making this situation right for me!

UPDATE: Not sure if it was a result of this post or not, but I am finally getting proper attention from Nvidia Support now. Should be getting a phone call from their escalation department tomorrow. Thanks to everyone for the upvotes, and hopefully this pans out and gives others in a similar scenario some hope.

\-----------------

My purchase went through just fine. It got shipped on 3/5 and I was charged. Package got stuck right before delivery on 3/10. FedEx claims it was damaged and will return to sender. I open a ticket with Nvidia Marketplace support. They claim I will be provided with a replacement RTX 5090. They go silent for days, and the item doesn't move per FedEx tracking. Then my order status disappears from the Nvidia Marketplace. Now I just received an email saying that Nvidia Marketplace is going back on their word and they will be refunding me.

I have no option to get back into the Verified Priority Access program and I have been robbed of my opportunity to purchase a 5090 because FedEx destroyed mine. This sucks. u/NV_Tim bailed on us in the other thread and now I've been screwed out of the 5090 FE I earned through VPA and just because FedEx damaged it.

2025-04-02,Bought NVDA at the wrong time? Not sure what to do next,"Hi everyone,

I know absolutely nothing about investing. My understanding is just: I buy stocks, they can go up or down, and I either make or lose money.

On January 6th, I bought 73 shares of NVIDIA. I had heard from friends that they made good money with it, so I thought I’d try it too.

I’m from Brazil, and I paid BRL 1,381.61. Now my investment is worth BRL 951.92 — that’s a loss of BRL 429.24.

Looking at the chart on Google, it seems like I got unlucky and bought right before it dropped.

My question is: should I just accept the loss and take my money out before it drops more? Or should I leave it there and hope for the best?

I honestly have no clue what might happen next, and to be honest, I’m not really interested in learning more about investing — I just want to make a reasonable decision here.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Based on the comments, I think it's important to clarify that I didn't have any specific goal with this investment — I just wanted to grow my money over the long term. I was aware of the risk of losing money, so I only invested an amount I was comfortable with potentially losing. From what I've read in the comments, it seems like holding onto these shares for the long term might actually be a good idea (Apparently even buying more haha).",0,98

Nvidia Stock Is Falling. Not Even Chip Exemption Saves It From Broad Slump.

2:28 PM-Apr 3

NVDA

By Adam Clark

Nvidia looks set to fall sharply following President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports to the U.S. The chip maker escaped specific levies but the wider market reaction and fears of Chinese retaliation are set to drag on the shares.

Nvidia shares were down 3.2% at $106.93 in the Thursday premarket having tumbled 5.7% at $104.15 in after-hours trading. The stock rose 0.3% during Wednesday's session.

The tariff announcement wasn't quite as bad as it could have been for Nvidia. Trump said the levy on imports for Taiwan - where Nvidia's chips are mostly manufactured - will be set at 32%. However, the White House published a fact sheet after Trump's announcement that said semiconductors would not be subject to that reciprocal tariff.

That doesn't mean chip tariffs are off the table entirely. Products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and lumber will be addressed separately, a senior administration official said.

The other major concern is likely to be potential retaliation from Beijing, with Chinese goods now facing total duties of 54% after the latest tariff announcements.

Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.8% in after-hours trading and Broadcom was down 6.3%.

Meanwhile, Nvidia on Wednesday said its Blackwell computing platform set performance records in tests for inferencing - the process of generating output from Al models - carried out by MLCommons, an open engineering consortium.

There has been speculation over whether Nvidia's dominant position in Al chips would weaken as the focus shifts from training Al models to inference. The company has pushed back hard against that, noting inference makes up around 40% of its data-center revenue and is growing fast. It says that its NVL72 server system delivers a fourfold improvement in Al model training but up to a 30 times improvement in inference compared with previous systems.

That doesn't mean chip tariffs are off the table entirely. Products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and lumber will be addressed separately, a senior administration official said.

The other major concern is likely to be potential retaliation from Beijing, with Chinese goods now facing total duties of 54% after the latest tariff announcements.

Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.8% in after-hours trading and Broadcom was down 6.3%.

Meanwhile, Nvidia on Wednesday said its Blackwell computing platform set performance records in tests for inferencing - the process of generating output from Al models - carried out by MLCommons, an open engineering consortium.

There has been speculation over whether Nvidia's dominant position in Al chips would weaken as the focus shifts from training Al models to inference. The company has pushed back hard against that, noting inference makes up around 40% of its data-center revenue and is growing fast. It says that its NVL72 server system delivers a fourfold improvement in Al model training but up to a 30 times improvement in inference compared with previous systems.

2025-04-11,FedEx Stole My 4090 FE RMA Inbound to Nvidia - I'm having a panic attack,"I am making this post to share my nightmare I'm dealing with to this subreddit and the world, and to just vent my frustration right now.

In October 2022, I bought the 4090 FE from Best Buy and used it for over 2 years just fine no problem. In January 2025 I bought a Corsair HX1500i PSU to replace my aging EVGA 850w T2.

2 weeks later, while upgrading my case, I happened to catch the cable starting to melt in the GPU. I snapped photos, contacted Nvidia customer support, and got an RMA to have the connector/card replaced with the newer 12v-2x6 standard. They gave me a FedEx shipping label to send the card to their Omni RMA center in California.

I was already feeling queasy about sending this card out there. I was googling around about Nvidia FE RMA stories and saw a bunch of horrible situations where users got back physically damaged cards, cards that didn't work, cards with people's hair intertwined in the fans and heatsink, etc. But no one seemed to have an exact situation like mine where the card was stolen in transit to the RMA department from the customer. 

My card arrived on March 26th, Wednesday after a noticeable delay in New Mexico. A week went by and I didn't hear from anyone at Nvidia so I decided to email their customer support about getting a status for my RMA.

I just received the reply tonight: my card wasn't in the box, and they claim no signs of tampering were present on the packaging.

My heart sank, my stomach is in knots, and I feel like I'm going to throw up.

They told me I will have to file a claim with FedEx. I've also seen reports in the past on this very subreddit where users were in a similar situation and they were told only Nvidia can make the claim since it was their paid shipping label.

I don't know what to do at this point. I don't know who to contact, I don't know how to process this. I am devastated. God help me.",1172,309

# Key Takeaways

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

Last week, Morgan Stanley analysts named Netflix a [“top pick,”](https://www.investopedia.com/netflix-a-top-pick-for-morgan-stanley-on-expected-resilience-to-a-weaker-market-11712037) arguing the company could be well-positioned to withstand the current tariff landscape. The streaming giant has shown ""momentum” in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company’s overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

Netflix is [set to report its first-quarter results](https://www.investopedia.com/what-analysts-think-of-netflix-stock-ahead-of-earnings-q1-fy2025-11712295) after the market closes Thursday.",424,164
2025-04-16,Nvidia says it will record $5.5 billion quarterly charge tied to H20 processors exported to China,"Nvidia said on Tuesday that it will take a quarterly charge of about $5.5 billion tied to exporting H20 graphics processing units to China and other destinations. The stock slid about 4% in extended trading.

On April 9, the U.S. government told Nvidia it would require a license to export the chips to China and a handful of other countries, the company said in a filing.

2025-04-16,(04/16) Interesting Stocks Today - He who controls the (NVDA) chips controls the universe,"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [China Tells Airlines Stop Taking Boeing Jets As Trump Tariffs Expand Trade War](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/china-tells-airlines-stop-taking-boeing-jets-as-trump-tariffs-expand-trade-war)

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- Nvidia announced it expects a $5.5B charge in Q1 2026 due to new U.S. export restrictions on its H20 AI chips to China. These chips were lobotomized versions initially designed to comply with earlier export controls but are now subject to stricter licensing requirements under the Trump administration's policies. I'm mainly interested if NVDA breaks $100 to the downside. The semis industry is volatile due to escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, affecting AMD and INTC (not as much) as well. Export policy volatility regarding semis exports will likely be in flux rather than having some kind of set policy and affect global AI chip demand. He who controls the spice controls the universe!!!!

[**IBKR (Interactive Brokers)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBKR&p=d)\- Reported Q1 adjusted EPS of $1.88 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $1.43B vs $1.42B expected. Despite the earnings miss, they announced a 28% dividend increase and a 4-for-1 stock split effective mid-July. Most of these brokerages have been selling off from the market peak around mid Feb, but I don't consider these to be interesting at the moment for outperformance, unless they fall further. Risks to watch out for in these include decreasing retail trading activity, fee compression, and competition from zero-commission platforms. (Also worth noting HOOD also fell from the Feb market peak)

[**META (Meta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)\- Zuck testified in an FTC antitrust trial about Meta's acquisition of Instagram, with internal emails suggesting shady motives. The FTC alleges the moves were to neutralize competition and monopolize the social media space. We've had a significant selloff for the past 2 months from 750 to 500, and while not extremely liquid due to price/volume, it's still worth pursuing if there is some catalyst for a forced sale of Instagram (unlikely). Risks include potential breakup rulings (this is the white whale trade), broader regulatory clampdowns, and increased oversight of tech M&A (we've seen less M&A already this year in the Trump admin mainly due to volatility).

[**ASML (Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography)-**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASML&p=d)  Reported Q1 net sales of €7.74B vs €7.8B expected, and net profit of €2.36B vs €2.3B expected. **Net bookings came in at €3.94B vs €4.89B expected, well below forecasts.** CEO flagged tariff-related uncertainty as a key risk to forward demand. Order shortfall is a bad sign (and also an explanation for why the rest of the semis fell as well). I typically don't trade super high priced stocks like this due to the spread but ultimately interested if we fall further to last week's levels (\~$600).",24,0
2025-04-17,OpenAI Just Showed Nvidia Bear Case Misunderstands the Reality of AI Scaling - $NVDA,"I keep seeing this recurring bearish argument that “more efficient models” like DeepSeek will reduce the need for massive compute, and therefore hurt Nvidia. That thesis simply doesn’t hold up to scrutiny — especially in light of OpenAI’s latest announcement today.

Take a look at the AIME performance chart from OpenAI’s new frontier model (o3). It shows a **direct, consistent correlation between compute usage and model performance**. More compute = better models. Full stop. No tricks, no shortcuts.

[https://imgur.com/a/MU2z77b](https://imgur.com/a/MU2z77b)

Yes, we’re seeing architectural improvements that increase training efficiency. But these gains don’t shrink the pie — **they expand it**. Every efficiency gain is reinvested into building even larger and more capable models. This is the scaling law trend, and Nvidia is at the center of it.

Now to DeepSeek: impressive optimization work, but let’s be real — their model is just riding on top of the massive foundation Nvidia enabled. DeepSeek’s “efficiency” is only relevant because **they still needed access to high-end GPUs to train it in the first place**. No one is training SOTA on CPUs or low-cost commodity hardware. Every frontier model — whether from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or DeepSeek — relies on Nvidia’s stack to get off the ground.

Here’s the bullish reality:

* Model performance still scales with compute — OpenAI just showed us that again.
* Efficient models don’t kill GPU demand; they unlock **even more ambitious models** and **more widespread deployments**.
* Inference is exploding. Every assistant, every copilots, every agent… all of them need sustained GPU access.
* Nvidia has built a full-stack moat: CUDA, TensorRT, networking, and ecosystem lock-in.

The smarter argument isn’t that Nvidia demand will fall — it’s that demand will **explode in more directions**: training, inference, on-device, edge. Efficient models don’t reduce Nvidia’s relevance. They increase the number of use cases and drive **horizontal expansion** of AI compute.",21,33

2025-05-10,"Update: FedEx Stole My 4090 FE RMA to Nvidia. IF YOU BOUGHT A USED 4090 FE RECENTLY, PLEASE READ THE BOTTOM","It's now been a month since I posted about the situation I found myself in when RMAing my 4090 FE to Nvidia over a early caught 12VHPWR connector melting. Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1jwd473/fedex_stole_my_4090_fe_rma_inbound_to_nvidia_im/

I wanted to give an update to my situation, and some important information for anyone out there looking to RMA anything valuable.

1. After making that post, the very next morning I went to the police department in the township from where the FedEx store I shipped my card out was, and filed a report for stolen goods.

2. I then went to the store, spoke with the manager who was an awesome guy and was very understanding and tried his best to help me. He reviewed the security footage for me, and confirmed that after I dropped off the package, the employee who took it brought it to the shelves area where packages are ready for pickup, and not even 15 minutes later a well-known upstanding employee came to collect them and brought them to the nearest hub (tracking timestamps prove that too.) So no theft occurred at the store itself.

3. Later this day, I contacted FedEx and asked them to open a claim. They refused as I am not the owner of the prepaid shipping label that Nvidia provided. They said I must get in contact with the company that owns it and have them file the claim.

4. I emailed Nvidia customer service back and told them this. They pointed to an FAQ on FedEx's website (https://www.fedex.com/us/quick_help/claims.html) that says anyone can file a claim, the sender, the receiver or even a third party.

5. Called FedEx back, mentioned this, and they still said no but the lady was willing to do a conference call with Nvidia customer service to go over this so I called Nvidia up at the same time, quickly explained the situation, and got them talking to each other. No specific information was given by the Nvidia rep, but his presence on the phone was enough to get the FedEx employee to go ""it's not going to work... but ok we'll submit it anyway.""

6. One week later on the day, FedEx emails me back saying the claim was denied with the following statement: ""After review, we are unable to approve your claim based on our records and the information provided. FedEx and the payer of freight charges has an agreement that all claims must be submitted through their corporate headquarters. Please contact the payer of the freight charges for any issues of loss, damage, or delay to your shipment."" Basically saying Nvidia has an agreement with FedEx that they must be the ones to file the claim, I cannot be the one to do it. Exactly what the FedEx lady told me would happen the day the claim was made, but Nvidia didn't care.

7. I forwarded the email straight to Nvidia's customer service in my case file, and this is their reply: ""We checked with the concerned team and unfortunately there is nothing much we can do from our end. We suggest you to continue working with Fedex and Police on this matter.""

8. I immediately called Nvidia customer service and demanded that they escalate this matter with the RMA team or someone at corporate headquarters to contact me about this because I get it, these low level support reps in India have no means of helping me any further, but someone at Nvidia who CAN process this claim should be getting in touch with me about doing the next step in the investigation as it's clearly beyond my control now.

This was over 2 weeks ago, and Nvidia has completely ghosted me ever since. I have heard nothing from them via email, phone, nothing. Time is just slipping by at this point and they are being totally uncooperative, when everything FedEx says (and everything you find online about companies providing prepaid shipping labels being the ones who must file the claim on behalf of the customer sending their products in, this is just standard practice) shows that Nvidia must be the one to take the next step.

I am reaching out in hopes someone from Nvidia or even a PC gaming journalist can see this, get in contact with me and the necessary departments to file this claim and make things right.

My lessons learned from this:

- DON'T use FedEx at all costs

- DON'T use a prepaid shipping label, especially if it is FedEx. Pay for your own shipping label so you are in control of any necessary claims processes, not some uncooperative corporation who doesn't care about you

- DO pay for the declared value coverage to replace your item in the event of a loss, and have the receipts to prove said value

- DON'T use anything but plain, unmarked packaging. I shipped my card out in a Newegg branded box. I believe this tipped off someone to investigate the label and put two and two together to open it

- DO use custom anti-tamper tape, NOT just plain clear packing tape

- DO film yourself inspecting the item at the shipper store, in clear view of their cameras, before boxing it up and handing it directly to their staff this way you have absolute evidence you did indeed ship it out

I think that about covers the most important details and best practice methodology when shipping something valuable and almost irreplacable.

---------------

One final note, for anyone who purchased a used 4090 FE after March 19th (the day I shipped my card), please check your serial number to see if you purchased my stolen card! The serial number is imprinted on the rear I/O bracket near the HDMI and DisplayPort connectors. Since my card is 100% gone I do not care about protecting my serial number. May as well share it in the hopes that someone has it and can get in contact with the police and me to catch the scumbags who stole it.

Serial number: 1323822000537

As further confirmation that this is my card, there will be a small bit of burnt plastic inside the power connector on the bottom right pin (unless the thief replaced the burnt connector, but the serial number would still match.)

This is a shot in the dark but at this point I am left with nothing else I can do. Someone mentioned in the original post that I could reach out to my state's Consumer Protections agency, and if I don't hear back from Nvidia with something moving this forward within 2 weeks, I will absolutely be taking that path because it is completely unacceptable that a company can just ghost a customer like this.

Intraday Trend and Technical Patterns: May 12, 2025 (Monday) NVIDIA shares jumped 5.44% to close at $123.00

Driven by the positive news of the U.S.-China tariff truce, the stock fluctuated in the range of $120.28 to $123.00 on the day's trading session, and the closing price was the highest point of the day, approaching the immediate resistance level of $124.92

Technically, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen to 87, indicating that the short-term is in overbought area and may face profit-taking pressure

The 50-day SMA is near $111.50, far below the current share price, verifying the recent strong upward momentum; while the 200-day SMA is about $125.04, slightly higher than yesterday's closing price, which is the highest point of the day. slightly above yesterday's close, implying that the stock is challenging long-term trend resistance

Key Support & Resistance: Technical support is currently around $114 The uptrend remains healthy if pullbacks don't break below this range

In the short term, the $125 neighborhood has become an important resistance level, corresponding to the 200-day SMA and the upper edge of the previous trading range

After opening on May 13, Nvidia shares continued to Nvidia's stock price continued to be strong, up about 2-3%, and at one point during the session broke through the $125 key resistance level (market capitalization). (market capitalization also close to $3 trillion)

The market expects that with the previous day's surge and high RSI, the stock may see a small increase after hitting the resistance level. Resistance may be followed by a small pullback or consolidation to absorb short-term profit-taking

If it manages to hold above $125, it is expected to turn that level into new support and set the stage for further upside; potential targets above include 52-week highs of 153.13

Nvidia CEO Jensen Haung has quantified the revenue impact of the U.S. government’s latest move to limit chip exports to China: $15 billion.



Last month, the administration effectively banned Nvidia’s H20 chips to China by tightening chip export licensing requirements to the Asian country. At the time, Nvidia said it expected to take a $5.5 billion charge related to inventory and purchase commitments from the new restrictions for its fiscal first quarter.

“This additional ban on Nvidia’s H20 is deeply painful,” Huang said in a Stratechery interview published on Monday. “We walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably—what is it? — $3 billion worth of taxes” for the U.S.

Critics have said offering Nvidia’s artificial-intelligence chips to China—even one or two generations old—can help companies in China catch up to the U.S. in AI technology. Huang disagrees. He believes the restrictions are shortsighted and will, in reality, help China in the long run.

A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.

The restrictions opens the market in China for increased usage of Huawei’s AI chips, he said. If more companies use Huawei’s chips and the Chinese company can refine its software, Nvidia’s current CUDA software advantage could erode.

“Anybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed,” Huang said. “If we don’t compete in China, and we allow the Chinese ecosystem to build a rich ecosystem because we’re not there to compete for it, and new platforms are developed and they’re not American at a time when the world is diffusing AI technology, their leadership and their technology will diffuse all around the world.”

The executive also argues by limiting access to Nvidia’s products it forces companies to provide financial resources to Huawei, which the company will then use for R&D to compete with Nvidia.",581,61

(Bloomberg) — The Trump administration will maintain efforts to keep advanced artificial intelligence technology out of China’s hands, a top White House official said, brushing off calls from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world’s second largest economy.

“We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “When it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” the country, he added.

While the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang’s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created “GPU haves and GPU have nots.”

“When it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,” Krishnan said. “On that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.”

Krishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a “failure” and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.

Huang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. “China has 50% of the world’s AI developers, and it’s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,” he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.

Krishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies’ access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.

“These deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,” said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. “Most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.”",172,31

2025-05-25,"Nvidia earnings Trump tariff updates, and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge: What to know this week","Stocks' feverish rebound over the past month is now on pause as growing concerns about the fiscal deficit have sent Treasury yields roaring higher and President Trump is once again threatening to escalate tariffs.



On Friday, Trump threatened to place a direct 25% tariff on Apple products not made in the US while also warning he'd ramp up duties on the European Union to 50% at the start of June. This solidified a week of decline for stocks as the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (\^DJI) dropped about 2.4%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (\^GSPC) slid roughly 2.6% on the week.



In the week ahead, updates on the trade war and Trump's pending tax bill will remain in focus, while quarterly results from Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to take center stage on Wednesday after the market close. Reports from Okta (OKTA), Salesforce (CRM), and Costco (COST) will also receive investor attention.



The release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge on Friday will headline the economic data schedule. Markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day.



Tariff escalation

President Trump's policies have continued to drive markets. Concerns over Trump's tax bill boosting the government deficit have pushed Treasury yields higher. At over 5.1%, the 30-year Treasury yield (\^TYX) had been hovering near its highest level since 2007, while the 10-year Treasury yield (\^TNX) had pressed above 4.6%, its highest level since February.



But the sell-off in bonds eased on Friday as Trump once again threatened to escalate tariffs, sending a reminder to investors that even with a 90-day tariff pause on a wide swath of countries, the trade policy whipsaw in markets is far from over.



""Safe to say for the time being we’ve hit 'trough' trade uncertainty,"" Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a note to clients on Friday. ""At this point markets need to see these tariffs retracted AND bond yields to not spike again for any material move higher.""



Friday's decline in treasuries sent the 10-year below the key 4.5% level Kantrowitz has been watching. As Kantrowitz highlights in the chart below, once the 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5%, interest rate-sensitive stocks have seen increased underperformance in recent years.



This played out in last week's market action with the Russell 2000 Index (\^RUT), which has many companies with more interest rate exposure than the S&P 500, falling nearly 4% compared to the S&P 500's 2.6% decline.



The AI leader reports

Nvidia is set to report quarterly results on Wednesday after the market close. Investors will be closely watching for any updates on demand from the leading supplier of AI chips. For the quarter, Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.88 on revenue of $43.3 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus data. The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $26 billion in the same period last year.



Given Nvidia's position as one of the top holdings in the S&P 500, investors will also be watching how the report affects other tech stocks and the broader market. Shares of Nvidia are roughly flat this year after whipsawing amid growing fears of AI competition and tariff concerns.



Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia alone has accounted for about 17% of the S&P 500's gains.



Price check

Tariffs have increased fears that inflation could spike again. But there's been little evidence of a resurgence thus far in economic data, and economists expect a similar story to play out in the coming week.



A fresh look at a key inflation measure will come on Friday with the April PCE release. Economists project annual ""core"" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.5% in April, down from the 2.6% seen in March. Over the prior month, economists project ""core"" PCE at 0.1%, above the 0% seen the month prior.",92,45

Ahead of the [company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) — formed what would come to be known as the [""Magnificent Seven.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[ three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

2025-05-28,Nvidia's Long-Term Prospects Remain Terrific - I'm going to ignore Q1-earnings noise.,"Nvidia (NVDA) $135 Pre earnings

Nvidia’s Q1-FY2026 results may be noisy, but I’m not hedging it; I own shares, remain long-term bullish and will ignore earnings volatility, and may even add more.

Institutional or other investors who emphasize Blackwell absorbing H20 losses (About $13 Bn in lost annual sales and $5.5Bn in chargebacks for unsold inventory-due to the government ban on H20 exports to China) may be trying to thread the needle, **either believing that the markets will not be happy with the Blackwell ramp or the speed of the ramp to mitigate these lost sales. But for a company that is firing on so many cylinders, I’m sanguine about the Q1-FY2026 results, and am absolutely positive about the long-term prospects – it’s business as usual for the best of the best. This is a once-in-a-lifetime** opportunity, and for once it’s not a cliche.

The momentum around inferencing, and the computing power needs for inferencing and reasoning models suggest that Nvidia’s is a supply problem – and even if the $ 200 Bn revenue estimate for FY Jan 2026 is off by a small percent, FY 2027 to FY 2030, will more than make up for it. 

Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore, who has an Overweight rating and $160 price target on Nvidia, said the Jensen Huang-led company is likely to be fine if it can show investors that rack supply has accelerated.

**“Our data points would suggest that in recent weeks, the full year rack forecasts have started to be revised upwards by 50 %+,” Moore added, citing recent channel checks that suggest the issues have been resolved and are now starting to show up in numbers.**

**Additionally, investors appear to be underestimating the “unprecedented explosive token growth” commentary coming from Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Moore posited.**

**“Every hyperscaler has reported unanticipated strong token growth,” Moore explained. “But our conviction is not driven by that, it’s driven by the fact that literally everyone we talk to in the space is telling us that they have been surprised by inference demand, and there is a scramble to add GPUs.”**

Moore continued: “This is not driven by the limitless aspirations for training megaclusters fueled by highly speculative venture capitalists; **this is proof that the models are being used, and driving revenue,** which mitigates the biggest overhang on NVIDIA stock that this is all driven by venture funding that will dry up. **The strength we highlight here is driven by usage, by the revenue-generating part of the business, and provides proof points that the scaling of inference as we move to reasoning-oriented models is a real thing.** We are seeing this spanning geographies, as well, so published concerns about China having stockpiled H20s seem inaccurate.”

**I think Nvidia will have a similar overwhelming market share and growth in inference GPUs and their 1 year product roadmap ensures that they remain ahead of the competition– this is just the beginning.**",23,19

* On April 9, 2025, we were informed by the U.S. government that a license is required for exports of our H20 products into the China market. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we initially anticipated as we were able to re-use certain materials. Sales of our H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. We were unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter.
* GAAP gross margin was 60.5%, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.76. Excluding the $4.5 billion charge and related tax impact, first quarter non-GAAP gross margin would have been 71.3% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $0.96.
* Revenue for the first quarter was $44.1 billion, up 69% from a year ago and up 12% sequentially.
* Data Center revenue for the first quarter was $39.1 billion, up 73% from a year ago and up 10% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. We saw our Blackwell architecture ramp expand to all customer categories, while large cloud service providers remained our largest at just under 50% of Data Center revenue. Data Center compute revenue was $34.2 billion, up 76% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. Networking revenue was $5.0 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 64% sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric in our GB200 systems and continued adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.
* Gaming revenue for the first quarter was a record, up 42% from a year ago and up 48% sequentially, driven by sales of our Blackwell architecture, the fastest ramp in company history.
* Professional Visualization revenue for the first quarter was up 19% from a year ago and flat sequentially. The increase from a year ago was driven by broader adoption of Ada RTX workstation GPUs, addressing workflows in AI acceleration, real-time graphics rendering and data simulation.
* Automotive revenue for the first quarter was up 72% from a year ago and down 1% sequentially. The increase from a year ago was driven by sales of our self-driving platforms
* NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on July 3, 2025, to all shareholders of record on June 11, 2025.

2025-06-04,"Nvidia regains ""most valuable company"" title for the first time since January","Nvidia passed Microsoft in market cap on Tuesday, once again becoming the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

Shares of the artificial intelligence chipmaker rose about 3% on Tuesday to $141.40, and the stock has surged nearly 24% over the past month as Nvidia’s growth has persisted even through export control and tariff concerns.The company now has a $3.45 trillion market cap. Microsoft closed Tuesday with a $3.44 trillion market cap.

Nvidia has been trading places with Apple and Microsoft at the top of the market cap ranks since last June. The last time Nvidia was the most-valuable company was on Jan. 24.

2025-06-05,Is NVIDIA Getting Too Hot? My Short-Term Concerns with NVDA ($141.92),"I wrote my thesis on Palantir 30 mins before posting this one and looks like folks are not liking it. Long term NVDA could go up. This is purely a short term play. 

This is going to be a similar take to that one. 

NVIDIA’s been on an insane run lately. It was up over 20% since mid May and pushing back to all time highs around $142. The AI hype is obviously still alive and well. I genuinely believe AI is the future but still we need to be a bit more realistic.

Here’s what’s making me cautious:

* Options activity is nuts right now — the $140–$150 calls are getting snapped up like crazy
* Lots of short-dated call buying, mostly retail
* The whole “it can’t go down” vibe is creeping back in
* The stock’s up 10–12% straight with barely any pause

To be clear, I’m not saying NVDA is a bad company. It’s a beast, and the AI story is real. But even the strongest stocks usually pull back a bit after a move like this.

I’m looking at a possible short if it pushes into the $143–$145 range. Nothing aggressive, just a trade idea. Thinking we could see a pullback to $135ish (which lines up with the last breakout zone).

If it breaks above $147 though, I’m out. Could easily rip to $150+ from there.

Not trying to fade the long-term trend here. I am just synthesizing unusual market activity, insider moves, options flow, sentiment, technical and news analysis.

2025-06-26,ASML as a partial hedge for NVDA?,"I was discussing this with a friend. Both are huge in the semiconductor industry but ASML is a better monopoly. If demand for semiconductors continues to rise, wouldn't ASML benefit as much as Nvidia being a critical part of the supply chain but with the additional benefit of revenue from other chip designers if you're worried about rising competition against Nvidia? For the same reason, wouldn't ASML partially hedge against a decline in Nvidia's stock if you're worried about Nvidia's valuation but bullish on semiconductors? Also, ASML itself is very cutting edge on the innovation with hyper-NA etc.

To be clear, I would still hold Nvidia I'm just wondering if this logic of using ASML to cover a bit of Nvidia is sound.

2025-06-30,The NVDA journey has just begun,"Nvidia is at the centre of the AI revolution, with breakthrough products and great opportunities ahead that continue to exceed my expectations.

Recent innovations such as the Blackwell GB200 NVL72 and expanding AI applications, including robotics, solidify Nvidia's dominant market position and growth potential.

Despite a record valuation, Nvidia's history of growing profits at a rate above valuation is unlikely to end.

I remain a committed long-term buyer of NVDA and I believe that Nvidia's leadership in AI and data centre technology makes it a must-have stock, despite the short-term risks.

How about now? NVIDIA's stock price and valuation just hit an all-time high, and many investors are wondering if NVIDIA is overvalued. Maybe they should take profits? Surely we'll see some short sellers active. For me, the journey has just begun. Since my recent article NVIDIA has announced some significant partnerships and at the recent GTC Paris conference its CEO made it clear to me that the growth story behind AI is continuing to accelerate. Let me bring you up to speed while we review whether NVIDIA remains a worthwhile buying opportunity.

It's worth noting that the US or Asia aren't the only ones committed to AI development - Europe is also active and not far behind. While Europe isn't often mentioned in these discussions (there's even a joke that the US owns AI while Europe has an ‘AI Act’ to regulate it), NVIDIA has highlighted its involvement in industrial/physical AI From the heart of Germany's automotive industry to the manufacturing hubs of France and Italy, Europe is adopting industrial AI and advanced AI robotics to address labour shortages, increase productivity and drive sustainable economic growth.

Robotics companies are developing humanoid robots and collaborative systems to integrate AI into real-world manufacturing applications. Backed by a $200bn investment programme and a coordinated effort by the European Commission, Europe is at the forefront of the next wave of AI-driven industrial automation.

It's easy to get caught up in concerns about potential overvaluation once the stock hits another record high. Take a look at NVDA's P/E ratio trend (I usually focus on EV/EBITDA, but it's showing the same trend). Since April 2025, the P/E has risen significantly as valuations have experienced a dynamic recovery (over 50%).

What's the key to deciding whether it's worth paying nearly $50 per share for $1 in earnings? It's the growth story behind NVIDIA and its continued path. NVIDIA's performance over the past few years suggests that it has a very good growth habit to reach its valuation levels. Just look at its P/E ratio in July 2023 - over 240x! Now, what surprises me is that buyers of NVIDIA actually made a lot of money during that time :)

How is that possible? NVIDIA's earnings are growing faster than its valuation. That's why you observe that valuation multiples have been declining since early 2024. Yes, the valuation multiple is now up nearly 50x, but ...... if NVIDIA continues on this path, delivers on its intended product roadmap, and the world continues to move towards an AI-driven economy, NVIDIA's current valuation will look cheap in a few years.

Risk factors? There are many, and there are no risk-free investments in the stock market. If the Trump administration escalates the trade war, which is currently on hold, NVIDIA could face some short-term issues that would impact NVIDIA's supply and customer operations. Yes, NVIDIA is well prepared for these changes, with some production being shifted to the U.S. and adjusted supply for Chinese customers (due to export restrictions). Any economic or geopolitical fluctuations could also hurt market sentiment, but in the long run I don't see this as a factor.

So, as an investor with a long-term focus and a bright future for NVIDIA, not only am I not selling any shares, I'm adding to my holdings. For me, NVIDIA remains a ‘Strong Buy’ stock. Cheers!",0,17

2025-07-10,Today I made $1m gains by selling my entire Nvidia portfolio,"Today marks perhaps my greatest investing milestone of all time!  The short story is I bought $36,000 worth of Nvidia over the course of 8 years. Last year I told myself once my account breaks $1m profit, I will sell the entire position, lock in the gains, and have a hell of a story to share for life.  Well today Nvidia hit a new all time high and I made that dream come true.

Below is a long version of how it all came to be: 

I first acquired Nvidia back in Feb 2017 and in a few lump sum purchases wound up with a total of 6,500 shares of NVDA.  My first purchase was for 1080 (in honor of my GTX 1080 I bought that year) and the share price at the time was a whopping $2.77!  My total investment around this time was $4000.  

Edit: I looked up the actual purchase numbers and the number of shares was actually 27 at $110 but since Nvidia had split multiple times, the number shown in my report today was reflecting those splits.  End of edit 

Back in 2017 all the talk was about Crypto mining and I naively thought Nvidia was the way Bitcoin would be mined forever so I bought into the mantra “during a gold rush, buy the company selling the shovels”.  This was around the time BTC hit $20,000 for the first time but it quickly collapsed and I was introduced into the volatility of the crypto world.  But I still held my Nvidia because I believed crypto was still at an early adoption stage.  

Over the next few years I continued to buy small amounts of Nvidia, in chunks of 100 shares here, 900 shares here, and eventually had 6,000 shares by 2019.  The average cost of all of these were around $2-$8 in today’s value.  

2019 is a significant milestone for me because I made a major life decision to move to Puerto Rico.  This move was made for several reasons but one consideration is the 0% tax on capital gains from stock sales.  I didn’t consider Nvidia being the one stock to move for but one reason for selling the whole lot was to lock in the 0% capital gains today 

I remember somewhere around 2019-2020 starting to think that GPUs and Nvidia specifically weren’t going to be tied to crypto as much as it would be the hardware needed to power self driving cars.  The hype around Tesla was growing and crypto mining started moving away from personal computers and I learned GPUs were falling out of favor for more powerful ASIC mining rigs.  So my mentality moved from Crypto to Electric Vehicles.  Keep in mind, I really didn’t know a lot about any of this and I view my Nvidia convictions at the time more as luck looking back.  

Then in 2020 the Pandemic hit and we saw major sales of GPUs for gaming, virtual reality, and supply chain disruption and of course massive inflation.  Stocks across the board were super volatile but in general things went bonkers in the tech sector.  Tesla was killing it and Nvidia might have doubled during this time.  It still had not gone parabolic yet but I still just kept holding onto my initial position.  My portfolio wasn’t really moving in any major way yet and in early 2019 I was actually slightly negative in my total Nvidia investment.  

Then in 2023 we saw the first mainstream use cases for Ai started popping up.  I’m in the photography and videography world so I noticed how disruptive image and video creation would be as soon as it hit.  All my colleagues were making images in Midjourney when the majority of my non photo friends had no clue what Ai image generation even was.  It ballooned quickly and that’s when my mind set changed a third time. Now Nvidia was going to be needed for data centers and personal computers to power this new Ai revolution.  It wasn’t about crypto or self driving cars anymore, it was about perhaps the biggest innovation humanity has seen since the internet was launched and the iPhone was revealed.  

Seemingly overnight my portfolio was sky rocking.  Where just a few years prior, Nvidia was in the red for me, it quickly started carving out a large portion of my portfolio.  Once a liability, Nvidia now made up 10%, 20%, and 30% of my entire investment account and retirement funds.  There were days when I would log in to see I had made $100,000 that day and a week later it would swing down -$105,000.  It was pretty crazy to see a full year’s worth of income bouncing around day by day in my account.  The temptation to sell had always been there since 2017 when I was up 20-100% but now I was up 4,000% and the temptation was even greater.  Every single one of my friends was telling me I had to take profits off the table.  I wound up holding.  

The last major purchase I made was in July 2021. I bought 400 shares for $14 which at the time was 3-5x what I had bought previously.  

Jump to June 2024 when Nvidia hit an all time high of $130.  My wife and I had just had our first child and my Nvidia position was hovering around $800,000 in total gains.  I knew I only had to make it to $160 per share to break the $1m mark and I told myself I would sell everything if that happened.  Of course the next month Nvidia corrected pretty hard and the reality of hitting $160 didn’t seem possible until July 3rd 2025, nearly a year after I made my original decision to sell.  

I should have sold everything on July 3rd but I didn’t realize the trading day was shortened for the 4th of July holiday coming up. I also didn’t setup any automated sell triggers since I wanted to ceremoniously do the trade myself.  It worked out in my favor as I was able to sell today at $163 and make a little more than the $1m cutoff I originally set to sell at. 

Here are the raw numbers:

Total invested: $36,352
Total sale: $1,059,591
Total gains: $1,023,238
Average cost per share: $5.60
Time to materialize: 8 years and a lot of emotional rollercoasters!


I know a lot of people get caught up in fancy investment options that feels more like gambling but hopefully this success story inspires those of you who are like me and just what to buy shares, hold them, and eventually offload them when the time seems right.

2025-07-10,NVDA In-Depth Discussion Post: why do AI giants continue to strengthen? Up or down? My view at the end.,"Latest data and market performance 

As of today, Nvidia shares are trading at $162.44, with an intraday high of $164.71 (hitting the $4T market cap threshold), a slight intraday pullback, but generally stable, and up over 40% over the past three months, with a cumulative gain of \~20% since 2025 - a wave largely driven by the AI boom!

AI Demand Rampage: Blackwell Sovereign AI 

Blackwell architecture chips (including GB200 datacenter products and RTX 50 series) continue to drive datacenter and high-end gaming markets, with high demand through 2024-25 

Sovereign AI ""Wave: Citi raises target price to 190, focusing on strong growth in demand for government-grade AI deployments, AI data center market expected to grow to $563B by 2028

NVDA financial performance: far exceeded expectations 

Q1 2025 revenue reached $44.06B, up 69% y/y; of which data center revenue was $39.1B, up 73% y/y. ytd stock price rose 21%, more than triple in 3 years, the market is optimistic about continued expansion in the next 2 years.

Pullback pressure and potential risks: export restrictions impact: up to $8B of China sales are restricted, short-term profits and revenue there is a non-negligible disturbance 

valuation height: although a number of institutions still maintain a Strong Buy, the target price is mainly concentrated in the $174-$190 range, the potential upside space is limited.

Competition and macro uncertainty: AMD, Broadcom and other rivals continue to force, and the global economy, interest rates and policy may become uncertain launch factors.

My short-term technical outlook and market observation 

If the US market pulls back due to macro risks, NVDA will also be under short-term retracement pressure.

Resistance: $164.7-165 range highs are key, breakout could trigger a rally to $175-190. 

Support: $155-160. If broken, be wary of technical corrective pressure.

My view 

Long term holders: 

NVDA has AI “No. 1” status, architecture + chip + software ecosystem is mature, government and enterprise AI continues to expand, valuation is high but the next 3 years there is still a lot of room for growth.

Short-term traders: 

current position between resistance and support, high valuation stage, if touch export restrictions or macro negative, or 5-10% retracement opportunities. If it breaks $165, short-term follow-through long can be considered.

Conclusion Summary: 

Supporting factors: Blackwell chip architecture, AI demand continues to explode, government programs pushing Sovereign AI levels up, strong earnings.

Risk factors: export ban, valuation near record highs, increased competition, macroeconomic uncertainty.

What do you think?

Is the global government embrace of AI a bubble or a trend?

Will NVDA correct again in the short term? At what price would you take a position?

2025-07-11,Trump posted: ‘The stock market is at an all-time high and interest rates should be cut immediately’!,"Former U.S. President Donald Trump just posted heavy rhetoric on social media, praising tech, industrial stocks and cryptocurrencies for their big gains and strongly calling on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Let's break down what he said and analyze the current state of the market with the latest data. Tech stocks, industrial stocks, Nasdaq hit record highs, cryptocurrencies “break through the sky” Nvidia (NVDA) is up 47% since the tariffs, the U.S. made hundreds of billions of dollars from the tariffs the country came back and called on the Fed to immediately cut interest rates declaring that “there is no inflation” .

How does the market interpret this?

Expectations for rate cuts are heating up: inflation is falling back + political heat is rising in a campaign year, Trump's statement may create some public pressure on the Fed (although its independence remains).

Tariffs negative turned positive? : Despite initial concerns that the market was under pressure, from the perspective of capital rotation, industrial, AI and defense stocks have risen, and it seems that the “Made in the USA” narrative is stronger.

Nvidia became a symbol: as the AI concept leader, NVDA after the tariffs rose against the trend, became the representative of the “no fear of policy uncertainty”, ARM, SMCI, AVGO, etc. also strengthened, the whole AI plate into the “revaluation period”.

Follow-up possible trend?

If the next Fed officials do not rush to suppress the rate cut expectations, the market may be the following scenarios

 Long beneficiary direction: tech giants (NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL), interest rate sensitive growth stocks (ARKK, SMH), industrial/infrastructure stocks (CAT, DE, GE)

Risks to watch out for: QQQ/SPY technicals are close to overheating, Powell or other officials release hawkish letters, earnings season is approaching, and there could be a “positive cash-out-on-decline” 

What do our Reddit friends think?

Do you think Trump is just “rubbing it in” or is the impact of his policies really being priced into the market?

Will the Fed turn dovish under this political pressure?

2025-07-15,NVDA eyes fresh highs as China sales may resume,"Looks like NVDA is back in the headlines (when is it not?)  this time with a shot at reclaiming lost ground in China

After months of silence and billions in lost revenue, Nvidia just said it's applying to resume sales of its H20 AI chips in China. The US government apparently ""assured"" them that licenses will be granted  which, if true, is a massive shift from the strict bans we saw earlier this year. Shares are ripping in premarket

What’s wild is that this comes just weeks after Jensen Huang met with Trump. Now he's in Beijing for a media briefing. Coincidence? Maybe. But the timing feels... calculated

Also worth noting: AMD is jumping too, riding Nvidia’s coattails and signaling that it might get the same green light. So maybe Washington's stance on AI chips to China is softening a bit?

Of course, even if deliveries resume, it’s unlikely to impact Nvidia’s current quarter much  too little time left. But if they can get chips flowing in Q3 and Q4, that’s a whole different story

Nvidia was already on a tear after breaking that $4T milestone, and now this could add more fuel. If they can recapture even part of that China demand, it could be another big leg up  Does this feel like a short-term bump, or a full-on policy pivot that could open the floodgates again?",71,10

2025-07-21,Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board,"Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‘...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...’

‘...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.’

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‘Buy’ rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market.",40,26

2025-07-31,Nvidia’s first-mover advantage is real but AMD is now ready to capture a significant share of the AI GPU market,"I think that AMD's release of the MI350 series of GPUs will give them a significant presence in the market for the following main reasons. First of all, the performance metrics I mentioned earlier put it on par with Nvidia in terms of hardware. Considering Nvidia's staggering GPU margins, AMD could offer a similar product at a much lower price to grab market share. In fact, there are reports that AMD has plans to raise prices, which one would guess indicates strong demand for its MI350 series.



While data center expansions may not have been worth it for developers in the past, hundreds of billions of dollars are currently being poured into GPUs for AI. Saving even a fraction of that would incentivize companies and their developers to use AMD's open-source ROCm platform instead of CUDA. in short, the GPU market is much larger than it used to be due to the demand for AI, and that changes the economics. In the past, it may not have been worth a developer's time to add a new server stack, but when building entirely new data centers specifically for AI, it makes sense to figure these things out if you can save even 10%.



Additionally, the AI market needs GPU resources both for training to build models and for inference to apply those models to solve problems in real-world scenarios. In the early days of the AI boom, training required more resources, or at least about half of each. In the future, reasoning resources are expected to grow faster than training resources. Fortunately (or more likely by design), products such as AMD's MI350 excel at inference and are on par with the Blackwell family. Here's how much AMD expects AI usage to continue to grow, with breakthroughs in training and inference",46,17
2025-08-01,Would You Rather Hold NVDA or VOO for the Next 6 Months?,"From what I have seen since pre-covid, capital is constantly flowing from one sector to another. I don't believe diversifying into different companies, is as important as the actual sector or asset class.

I saw Nvidia’s Discounted Cash Flow fair valuation, on https://stockvalu8or.com/dcf-calculator, to be $90.33. With similar valuations revolving around $90-$120, and Nvidia’s current price being $178, $NVDA has almost zero upside.

2025-08-07,Is $NVDA’s market dominance over?,"Everyone's piling into $NVDA like it's free money, but the disconnect between price and targets is getting weird. I saw Nvidia’s Discounted Cash Flow fair valuation, on https://stockvalu8or.com/dcf-calculator, to be $90.33. With similar valuations revolving around $90-$120, and Nvidia’s current price being $178, $NVDA has almost zero upside. 

How does everyone love it but see no upside? Even weirder, the stock is up 171% in 2024 and another 25% in 2025, trading at 55.96 P/E with a $4 trillion market cap, most semiconductor peers trade at 15-30x earnings. $NVDA at nearly 56x is pricing in perfection for years.

The competition is real now. Huawei's Ascend chips are growing in China, and NVDA took a $5.5 billion charge on H20 chip restrictions, here ‘Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (July 30) - 24/7 Wall St.’ Plus Microsoft announcing $30B quarterly capex, here ‘Meta, Microsoft stocks rise on strong earnings and AI spending boom,’ means everyone's building their own chips. How long before NVDA's moat erodes?

Some analysts see $5 trillion market cap potential, found here ‘Analysts raise Nvidia price targets after Trump's China chip decision. One sees $5 trillion market cap ahead,’ but 24/7 Wall St has a cautious $147.70 target - that's 15.8% downside, article found here ‘Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (July 30) - 24/7 Wall St.’ That's a massive spread between bull and bear cases.

Sustained capital-expenditure investments from hyperscalers, increased sovereign investments and adoption of enterprise AI are driving demand for GPUs even higher than originally expected, according to Muse. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh pointed out that Big Tech capex estimates have increased in recent months from 38% to 54% year over year. With analysts boosting outlooks on AI demand and hyperscaler capex, stocks like PLTR, BGM, CRM, and CRWV stand to benefit from the accelerating investment cycle.

Expect the magnitude of earnings beats to increase going forward, Muse wrote. He is anticipating second-quarter revenue of $48 billion and earnings of $1.06 per share. He’s also expecting Nvidia to raise guidance going into the third quarter.

Amkor handles advanced packaging for the chip, while Samsung Electronics supplies high-bandwidth memory chips for the model.Neither companies immediately responded to a Reuters request for comment.Meanwhile, Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement, ""We constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions.""""As both governments recognise, the H20 is not a military product or for government infrastructure.

2025-08-22,Performance chart for gamers looking to buy used Nvidia GPUs,"Just out of curiousity and boredom, I created a performance chart, based on **aggregated benchmark results**, to be able to better compare the gaming performance of the various Nvidia GPUs.

There are a variety of similar lists and performance benchmark charts online, but a lot of them [(Like Tom’s Hardware) lack a unified chart that includes all RTX generations](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html), and some of them (like [bestvaluegpu](https://bestvaluegpu.com/)) only base their performance ratings on one single benchmark.

The chart that I have made, then, has a Raw Performance rating based on six weighted benchmark results from 3DMark (Speed Way, Steel Nomad DX12, Steel Nomad Light DX12, Time Spy, Time Spy Extreme and Port Royal) as well as the [Passmark DX12 Video Card Benchmark](https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/directx-12.html). This gives us (I hope) a broad, overall performance rating for a relatively wide range of gaming use cases, from lighter/older games to new, raytracing-heavy AAA titles.

I thought that even though this chart is far from any rigorous, scientific undertaking, it might still be useful for others, **particularly for people looking to buy a used GPU and would like to get a good way to gauge the relative value of various different models**.

I can get back more to the methodology in the comments, but an important thing to say right away is that apart from the Raw Performance column, there is also a Weighted Performance one (which the 1-60 hierarchy is based upon), where the raw performance for each card is adjusted for VRAM (punishing cards with less than 16 GB) and – very slightly – for model generation (GTX cards lacking DLSS upscaling, 20-series cards having lacking HDMI 2.1x support, 30-series for not enabling frame generation, et cetera).

Sorta, kinda, with lots of caveats (and actually quite unintended), **the Weighted Performance rating aligns reasonably well with what I would consider to be a fair price in USD for a used GPU** (in good condition) of that particular model (at least on the Swedish/EU used market), from a strictly game performance-oriented perspective (which, for example, puts the 3090 at a lower price point than you would be likely to find on eBay, simply because its 24 GB of VRAM is overkill for the vast majority of games).

Hope at least someone here finds it useful!",2043,410
2025-08-23,Nvidia Launches Spectrum-XGS: What This Means for AI & Data Center Investing,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced on Friday its **Spectrum-XGS Ethernet**, designed to support data centers and AI super-factories. In late-morning trading, NVDA shares rose 1.7% on the news.

Here’s why this matters for investors:

* **AI Super-Factories & Data Centers**: Spectrum-XGS is designed to allow data centers to scale beyond their individual buildings. Nvidia calls it the **“third pillar” of AI computing**, complementing vertical and horizontal scaling. Essentially, it enables massive AI infrastructures across cities, countries, and even continents.
* **Performance & Efficiency**: The platform integrates with Nvidia’s Spectrum-X, automatically adjusting networks, controlling congestion, latency, and telemetry. Nvidia claims performance nearly **twice that of their Collective Communications Library (NCCL)**.
* **Enterprise Adoption**: Hyperscale companies like **CoreWeave (CRWV)** are already testing the tech, connecting their data centers to Spectrum-XGS Ethernet. Early adoption by industry leaders can indicate strong future demand.
* **Earnings Context**: Nvidia will report next-quarter earnings **after market close on August 27**, with analysts projecting **EPS of $1.01** and **revenue of $46B**.

**Investor Takeaways**:  
For long-term investors, this reinforces Nvidia’s positioning in AI infrastructure, beyond GPUs. The launch highlights continued growth potential in data center and AI markets. It may also influence investment strategies in other hyperscale tech companies and cloud infrastructure providers.",21,3

2025-08-26,NVDA Up 35% Into Earnings,"Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday (Aug 27) after the close, and the setup looks like a textbook high-stakes event. The stock is currently trading at $181.30, up over 35% in the past three months, and the technicals tell a mixed story heading into earnings. On the positive side, the long-term trend is still strong. Nvidia is trading above its 10-day ($179), 50-day ($167), and 200-day ($137) moving averages, which confirms that the uptrend remains intact and the bulls are in control on a broader timeframe.

However, the short-term signals show some cracks. The RSI sits at 73.4, which is firmly in overbought territory. To be clear, this doesn’t always mean the stock will drop immediately, but it does raise the probability of profit-taking in the near term. The MACD has slipped below the signal line (2.92 vs. 4.43), and the histogram has been shrinking since mid-August, indicating fading momentum. Volume has also flatlined while price continued to rise, often a sign that buyers are running out of steam ahead of a major catalyst.

Historically, Nvidia tends to move around ±8% after its earnings announcements. Given the massive run it’s already had this quarter, the risk/reward skews toward the downside. Yes, if Nvidia beats expectations and raises guidance, the stock could break through $190–200 and extend its rally. But with RSI overbought, MACD momentum weakening, and volume drying up, there’s also a real chance of a “sell the news” reaction back toward $170 to 160, even on solid earnings.

TLDR: The long-term trend remains bullish, but in the short-term, Nvidia is priced for perfection. Technicals suggest momentum is tiring, so investors should be prepared for volatility and not be surprised if the first reaction is red before the next leg higher.",373,160

2025-08-28,NVDA 2Q26 Earnings Result,"**Earnings per share**: $1.05, adjusted, up 54% from a year ago

**Revenue**: Revenue of $46.7 billion, up 6% from Q1 and up 56% from a year ago

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 27, 2025, of $46.7 billion, up 6% from the previous quarter and up 56% from a year ago. NVIDIA’s Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially.

There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter. NVIDIA benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory, from approximately $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales to a customer outside of China.

Data Center revenue for the second quarter was $41.1 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. We continue to ramp our Blackwell architecture, which grew 17% sequentially, including our newest architecture, Blackwell Ultra. We recognized Blackwell revenue across all customer categories, led by large cloud service providers, which represented approximately 50% of Data Center revenue.

Data Center compute revenue was $33.8 billion, up 50% from a year ago. Sequentially, compute revenue declined 1%, driven by a $4.0 billion reduction in H20 sales. Networking revenue was $7.3 billion, up 98% from a year ago and up 46% sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric for GB200 and GB300 systems, the ramp of XDR InfiniBand products, and adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.

**Outlook**  
NVIDIA’s outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:

2025-08-29,Alibaba unveils homegrown AI chip to replace Nvidia’s H20 in China,"No paywall: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-alibaba-develops-ai-chip-090846681.html

(Reuters) -China's Alibaba has developed a new chip that is more versatile than its older chips and is meant to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.

Alibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.

Nvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.

While the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.

Alibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.

Separately, on Friday, the company reported a 26% jump in revenue in its cloud computing segment for the April-June quarter, beating market estimates, on the back of solid demand.",1836,387

2025-09-12,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? 

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don’t make money, they burn money, so it’s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it’s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it’s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm’s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it’s going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won’t be pretty. The warning signs are already showing. ",50,28

2025-09-18,HUGE Deal Between $INTC and $NVDA,"NVIDIA and Intel announced a multi-generation collaboration across PC and datacenter and NVIDIA will invest $5B in Intel at $23.28 per share. The joint solution will be a tight coupling Intel x86 CPUs and NVIDIA RTX GPUs over NVLink for PCs and data-center platforms. Timeframe are TBD and current roadmaps with arm will not change, per sources, meaning NVIDIA will offer both.
 
Overall
 
•PCs: Intel will build and sell x86 SoCs integrating NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets
•Data center: Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA integrates into its AI platforms
•Financial: NVIDIA is committing $5B to Intel equity at $23.28/share
•Scope: Product collaboration—not a foundry manufacturing deal
 
Why it matters
 
•Windows/x86 PCs: Higher-bandwidth, lower-latency CPU-GPU coupling should lift AI inference and pro-app and gaming performance versus discrete PCIe designs. Data center: NVIDIA gains an x86 option alongside ARM; Intel attaches CPUs into NVIDIA’s fastest-growing AI platforms.
 
What we don’t know yet
 
•Ship timing, ramp cadence, and how many generations.
•NVLink specifics (bandwidth, flavor, coherence) and CPU-DRAM/GPU-HBM memory topology.
•Process nodes and packaging (EMIB/Foveros) for the PC SoC and the custom DC CPU.
•PC SoC scope (NPU, power targets, die/chiplet counts) and NVIDIA rack-level designs.

2025-09-23,Is AI the Future of the Stock Market and Investing? And is it Smart to Invest in AI now or in a Few Months?,"I can’t wrap my head around AI and how it will impact the future of the Stock Market and investing. AI is rapidly growing and becoming more smarter each day. People are starting to use AI more and more in their day to day lives, however many companies are starting to incorporate AI into their systems and software to help make them generate more money. I do believe AI is the “Next Big Thing” when it comes to investing and even the real world. Just alone in the past 2 Years, AI has advanced and grown a significant amount and is only proving that it will continue to do so. I have my eye on two stocks that have been doing very well, TSMc and NVDA. Both of these companies work together and have a good relationship, and they both heavily rely on each other. TSMc manufactures and produces these H20 chips which are directly correlated to powering AI. As time goes on AI will become more powerful and will be of use a lot more which will create more demand. I have a TFSA open (opened January 2024, and I have invested the maximum allocated limit ($7000 CAD a year) I have invested all of the money that is in my TFSA into ETF’s as it is one of the safest ways to invest and watch the money grow rather than depreciate because of inflation. In January 2026 when I can invest another $7000; I want to invest it all into AI. I was thinking of putting $3500 into TSMc and $3500 into NVDA. Both of these companies have been doing very well, and I do believe they will continue to do so. Is this a fair statement; and is it smart to invest in AI? I have played it safe in the last few years with putting all of my savings into ETF’s, but now I want to take a bigger risk with the possibility of great return. Do you agree with this, and what stocks would you invest in that is related to AI? ",0,7

Teradyne also surged on reports of increased adoption of its testers by TSMC.",5,1
2025-09-24,[Gamer Nexus] NVIDIA's Monopolistic Takeover,,277,691
2025-09-25,NVTS Navitas Semiconductor Run Incoming (NVDA Blackwell),"I’m picking NVTS for AI and Data Center Expansion. Basically this is a company specializing in next-generation power semiconductors, including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) technologies. These are used in high-growth areas like AI data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), mobile charging, and renewable energy.

•  NVTS eyeing revival through NVIDIA AI synergies—volume’s solid, but P/E flags caution. Buybacks could turbocharge if fundamentals align; divested $100M+ last year signals pivot potential.

•  Risk-reward tightening.. Upside from scale-ups and partnerships; downside on costs/delays.

•  Pre-market buzz tied to EV/AI tailwinds—partnership expansions and earnings guidance in focus.

•  Shares breaking 50-day MA on volume—technical setup for extension if momentum holds.

•  Despite revenue dip, EV/semi growth narrative intact—optimism hinges on delivery.

Not financial advice, DYOR, but if AI infrastructure bottlenecks persist (hello, NVIDIA Blackwell), NVTS could be the under-the-radar winner. At the current price, I’d say the room to run is to $16 after $9 breaks. We saw this on APLD. This narrative is the play.

Q3 earnings Nov 3 could spotlight AI progress; ECCE and WiPDA conferences in Oct/Nov for tech showcases; CES 2026 prep might drop EV bombshells via VREMT. Recent manufacturing ramps and CEO shakeup already juiced the stock 40% on news. I’m in for 700 shares already. When I hit 10K it’ll be a YOLO. 

Good luck to all 👊🏻",65,56

2025-09-27,Nvidia market cap looks kinda crazy maybe suppliers worth a look,"Nvidia passed 1 trillion market cap, everyone chasing AI story. i get it, gpu demand is huge, but from a value perspective maybe the suppliers have more reasonable entry.

Like with apple years ago, a lot of suppliers (foxconn, tsmc, luxshare etc) did well along the iphone cycle, sometimes with safer valuations than apple itself.

For nvidia chain there are smaller names too, e.g. won rong group, twowinit information, not famous, probably less hyped, but they also benefit directly from the gpu boom.

Just a thought. anyone here ever looked at supply chain plays instead of buying the main company?",100,4
