I asked for a free copy and to my surprise they said yes! Shout out meta for real.

2024-10-05,"Meta, challenging OpenAI, announces new AI model that can generate video with sound","https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/04/meta-announces-new-ai-model-that-can-generate-video-with-sound.html

> Facebook owner Meta announced on Friday it had built a new AI model called Movie Gen that can create realistic-seeming video and audio clips in response to user prompts, claiming it can rival tools from leading media generation startups like OpenAI and ElevenLabs. Samples of Movie Gen’s creations provided by Meta showed videos of animals swimming and surfing, as well as videos using people’s real photos to depict them performing actions like painting on a canvas. Movie Gen also can generate background music and sound effects synced to the content of the videos, Meta said in a blog post, and use the tool to edit existing videos.

> In one such video, Meta had the tool insert pom-poms into the hands of a man running by himself in the desert, while in another it changed a parking lot where a man was skateboarding from dry ground into one covered by a splashing puddle. Videos created by Movie Gen can be up to 16 seconds long, while audio can be up to 45 seconds long, Meta said. It shared data showing blind tests indicating that the model performs favorably compared with offerings from startups including Runway, OpenAI, ElevenLabs and Kling.

> The announcement comes as Hollywood has been wrestling with how to harness generative AI video technology this year, after Microsoft -backed OpenAI in February first showed off how its product Sora could create feature film-like videos in response to text prompts. Technologists in the entertainment industry are eager to use such tools to enhance and expedite filmmaking, while others worry about embracing systems that appear to have been trained on copyright works without permission.",128,43

Just the sheer madness, i know its just a multiple and future growth and all that. Still, you gotta take a moment to contemplate this.

2024-10-30,When should I get back into Meta?,"Today, Meta will report its earnings after the market closes. In the past, I bought shares when the company changed its name and faced significant backlash. I ended up selling within a year after doubling my investment, thinking I had done well. However, I realized I missed out by not allowing my winners to ride. It ended up doubling again in the coming year. I still have a strong affinity for the company and I'm trying to find a good entry point for a stock that continues to rise. What should I do?",0,12
2024-10-31,Meta beats on top and bottom lines but misses user growth expectations,"Meta shares were down 2% after the company reported third-quarter earnings in which it posted lower than expected daily active people.

Here are the results.

Earnings per share: $6.03 vs. $5.25 expected by LSEG

Revenue: $40.59 billion vs. $40.29 billion expected by LSEG

The company said it is expecting fourth-quarter revenue to be between $45 billion and $48 billion. The midpoint of that guidance is higher than the analyst consensus of $46.3 billion.

Meta said daily active people grew 5% year-over-year for the third quarter to 3.29 billion, which was lower than analyst expectations’ of 3.31 billion.

The company said that guidance for its fiscal 2024 total expense will be in the range of $96 billion to $98 billion, which is lower than previous guidance of $96 to $99 billion.

Meta said that capex guidance for the 2024 fiscal year will be between $38 billion to $40 billion, up from $37 billion to $40 billion.

Meta said that it expects capital expenditures to continue to grow significantly in 2025.

2024-11-01,META down on earnings as predicted.,"Elsewhere I explained to someone that earnings tend to be moments of mean reversion and that despite good expectations META was setting up to go down on earnings. Sure enough it has.

This is true with almost all earnings because, like sports betting, the more people who long a stock before earnings drives the price higher and for the market maker to break even they need to lose.

The more who sell before earnings drives the price lower and for market maker to break even it needs to drive the price higher.

It's all pretty basic auction theory spanning across Earnings plays. They are very predictable and for that reason they usually mean revert the cost of the options - a real tail wags dog scenario.",0,54
2024-11-01,So... is Meta simply ignoring the controller battery drain issues...?,"For months now, every time I turn on my Quest 3, the batteries on both controllers are completely dead. If I put my Quest 3 away for more than 2 or 3 days, it's basically a given that both controller batteries will be dead.

I see lots of threads about this issue both here and on Meta's official support forum. 

Have they simply been ignoring this issue for over a year...? This is incredibly wasteful and what's worse, the only possible workaround (constantly removing the batteries after each session) will introduce a lot of stress to some of the controller's moving parts. 

This has only started happening as of the last 2 or 3 months. 

What gives, Meta?",133,256

2024-11-28,$HIMS is about to get absolutely wrecked. ,"Meta is about to announce a major change to their advertising policies that will decimate HIMS ability to efficiently acquire customers via their most critical channel: Facebook and Instagram Ads.

This is because Meta will be restricting brands like HIMS from using purchase-optimized campaigns, which many are speculating is due to legal liabilities associated with HIPAA violations and the use of the Facebook Pixel, the essential ingredient to running the most profitable type of Facebook ad campaigns.

How do I know this? I run an agency that specializes in Facebook ads and I can tell you this is every FB/IG advertiser's worst nightmare. I would be in a total panic if this was happening to me.

I’ve tested running ads without purchase optimization over many years and I can tell you they are absolute dog shit for getting an ROI. Full stop.

Back to HIMS.

They are especially fucked because:

1. They have a client/patient portal that is subject to strict HIPAA requirements. These advertisers are being specifically targeted by this change.
2. They are overly reliant on Meta ads like many direct to consumer brands. Losing the ability to leverage the best optimization settings will be catastrophic to HIMS customer acquisition cost on day 1.

These changes are going into effect on January 1 and Meta is expected to officially announce it on December 5th. 

If HIMS doesn’t immediately take a hit upon this being announced then I see their Q1-Q2 earnings to look like a flatline after what will likely be their biggest Q4 ever.

2024-12-05,Protecting Gains on 300 META Shares Without Selling: Selling Deep ITM Calls Strategy,"
I currently hold 300 shares of META that I purchased back in March and have seen decent gains. I want to protect these profits without triggering taxes from selling before the one-year mark (to qualify for long-term capital gains).

I’m considering selling deep in-the-money (ITM) calls with March expiration. These options would expire shortly after my one-year holding period, so my shares would be eligible for long-term capital gains if exercised after expiration.

I understand that selling deep ITM calls could constrain my margin account while the options are open. Aside from that, are there any other risks or pitfalls I should be aware of with this strategy? For example:
	•	Could this strategy be flagged as a “constructive sale” by the IRS?
	•	What happens if the calls are exercised before the March expiration?
	•	Are there better alternatives to hedge while preserving my tax situation?

2024-12-05,Meta Announces $10 Billion Data Center in Louisiana,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a)

META, the parent company of Facebook, is spending $10 billion to build its largest data center ever in Louisiana, the company confirmed on Wednesday.

The data center will take up 4 million square feet of an industrial site in the northern half of the state that once held a headlight factory.

The center will be powered by three new natural gas plants with 2.2 gigawatts of combined capacity, according to Entergy, the utility working with the tech giant. That is enough to power more than one million homes. Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman, said the plants will also provide power to the surrounding community.

“Entergy raised its earnings growth outlook substantially (solely because of this 1 new customer) and the stock rose 15% on that day,” wrote Rodney Rebello, an analyst covering power stocks at Reaves Asset Management, in an email to *Barron’s*. “It’s a monumental deal for the sector.”

Meta spokeswoman Stacey Yip told *Barron’s* the Louisiana data center “will be significantly larger than our other data center campuses.”

The company didn’t say how many GPUs the new facility will be able to support. Yip said estimating the future number of GPUs is becoming complex as GPU technology becomes more efficient.

Yip also said Meta will invest in 1.5 gigawatts worth of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to reduce its carbon footprint. All told, Meta will help finance “enough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,” she wrote in an email.

But it isn’t clear when those renewable projects will start. Entergy has filed for permission with the state utilities commission to build the natural gas plants, but not the renewable ones yet, Kirby said.

Meta also said on Tuesday that it is exploring using nuclear energy to power data centers, and asked companies in that field to submit proposals for nuclear reactors. Any reactors wouldn’t be available until well into the 2030s, however.

Meta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence and has been expanding the number of data centers it uses to process its AI applications. But even as the AI race accelerates, this Louisiana data center doesn’t look like it will be completed soon. The company said construction will “continue through 2030 with site work beginning in December.”

2024-12-16,2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

>\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~24% and \~16%.",837,182
2024-12-17,Achieved my first milestone after 3 years!,"After 3 years of investing, I've finally achieved my goal of investing my first $100,000! This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*

I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. 

**Investment strategy:**

1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  
2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  
3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  
4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*

I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.

**Looking forward:**

Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!

My next goal will be to reach $300,000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think? Achievable?",75,25

2024-12-29,"Monthly Investing Update: $1,000/week Journey to Financial Freedom","Hey everyone!   
  
I am a longtime lurker, but I am hopeful people may feel inspired by financial journey over the last year or so.   
  
For background, I’m an assistant principal at a local elementary school, and my wife runs her own tutoring and education consulting business. Together, we’ve been focused on building a secure financial future while balancing busy lives. This post is part of my ongoing journey of consistent investing. As of November 13, 2023, I began contributing $1,000 weekly to my brokerage account. Previously, I had dabbled in investing since 2021 but without consistency.  I deposited a little extra money here and there, but I wasn't consistent in my approach and didn't prioritize it. This is my story and an update on where I stand today.

**Portfolio Snapshot as of December 2024:**  
  
Starting Balance (November 13, 2023): $44,403.12  
Current Balance (December 26, 2024): $131,615.84

**Monthly Contributions:** $4,000 - $5,000 (depending on the number of weeks per month)

**Lessons Learned:**

\- **Compounding Takes Time but Works:** I’ve started noticing compounding effects really kick in. Some months, my portfolio’s growth outpaced my monthly salary, which is both surreal and inspiring.

\- **Volatility is Real:** Watching significant swings in my portfolio value is tough. To manage this, I’ve adopted a ""set it and forget it"" mindset and avoid checking my account daily.

**- Stay Consistent:** It’s easy to get caught up in market trends and daily life, but staying consistent with contributions has been the most rewarding strategy.

**Why I’m Sharing:**

I hope to inspire others who might be hesitant about investing. I realize $1,000 isn't possible for everyone - I'm extremely lucky to be able to do this - but I think starting with even $50 a week or a month can be impactful. Financial independence is achievable with consistency, discipline, and patience. 

For transparency, I focus solely on my brokerage account in these posts, even though I also fully fund my Roth IRA, 403(b), and my wife’s self-directed 401(k). We also maintain a hands-off Acorns account with about $60,000. I’ve thought about moving that money to Fidelity but appreciate the safety and simplicity it offers.

**Looking Ahead:**

Starting in January, I plan to post each week to give a closer look at my journey. I’ll share more details on my strategy and lessons as they unfold.

If you have questions about my approach, portfolio, or anything else, feel free to ask! Thanks for following along, and good luck on your own investing journeys!",55,58

2025-01-07,UFC Chief Dana White to Join Mark Zuckerberg on Meta Board of Directors,"In a surprise move, UFC chief Dana White will join the board of directors of Meta Platforms Inc, the tech giant that owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — an avid mixed martial arts fan — announced the addition of White and two other board members, John Elkann and Charlie Songhurst, Monday.

“Dana, John and Charlie will add a depth of expertise and perspective that will help us tackle the massive opportunities ahead with AI, wearables and the future of human connection,” Zuckerberg said in a statement.

In a post on Facebook, Zuckerberg said that he had been working on add the nw board members for a while, and of White he wrote that “I’ve admired him as an entrepreneur and his ability to build such a beloved brand.”

“I’ve never been interested in joining a board of directors until I got the offer to join Meta’s board,” White added in a statement. “I am a huge believer that social media and AI are the future.”

“I am very excited to join this incredible team and to learn more about this business from the inside,” he added. “There is nothing I love more than building brands, and I look forward to helping take Meta to the next level.”

White joins John Elkann, the CEO of European investment firm Exor, and the executive chairman of Ferrari, and Charlie Songhurst, a veteran technology investor, on the board.

Zuckerberg and White are friendly, with the Facebook founder an occasional guest at UFC matches. Zuckerberg has also trained with UFC fighters, and competed in local MMA bouts in California.

White is also very close with incoming President Trump, who Zuckerberg and other tech moguls have tried to forge a relationship with ahead of his second term.

2025-01-07,"Meta scraps fact checking program, is bringing back political content","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/07/meta-eliminates-third-party-fact-checking-moves-to-community-notes.html

Meta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact checking program to “restore free expression” and move to a “Community Notes” model, similar to the system that exists on Elon Musk’s platform X.

The company said Community Notes will be written and rated by contributing users to provide more context to posts across its platforms, and the feature will roll out in the U.S. over the next couple of months. The announcement marks Meta’s latest attempt to smooth over relations with Republican President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office.

“We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes, and too much censorship,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Tuesday in a video announcement. “The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech, so we’re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms.”

Zuckerberg said the third-party fact checkers have been “too politically biased” and have “destroyed more trust than they’ve created, especially in the U.S.”

Meta said it will simplify its content policies by removing restrictions on subjects like immigration and gender and implement a new approach to policy enforcement that will focus on illegal and high severity violations. The company is moving its trust and safety and content moderation teams from California, a historically Democratic state, to Texas, a historically Republican state.

“We’re going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more,” Zuckerberg said.

Joel Kaplan, Meta’s head of global policy, appeared on “Fox and Friends” Tuesday and said Meta thinks the Community Notes system on Musk’s platform X has been working “really well.” Musk, who has been a vocal advocate for Trump online and donated millions of dollars to his campaign, has been in close contact with the president-elect since the election.

Last week, Meta said that Kaplan would become the company’s top policy officer, replacing Nick Clegg, who was a former British deputy prime minister and a leader of Britain’s centrist Liberal Democrats party.

Kaplan, who has held several policy related positions at Meta since joining the company in 2011 when it was still named Facebook, is well-known within the Republican party. He was a White House deputy chief of staff under former President George W. Bush and also once worked as a law clerk for former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.

In December, Kaplan revealed in a Facebook post that he joined Vice-President Elect JD Vance and Trump during their recent visit at the New York Stock Exchange.

“We want to make it so that, bottom line, if you can say it on TV, you say it on the floor of Congress, you certainly ought to be able to say it on Facebook and Instagram without fear of censorship,” Kaplan said Tuesday.

Prominent Republican lawmakers have previously criticized Meta and other technology companies for allegations regarding the censorship of conservative voices on their respective platforms. For instance, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, subpoenaed Zuckerberg and other tech CEOs in 2023 as part of a probe to “understand how and to what extent the Executive Branch coerced and colluded with companies and other intermediaries to censor speech.”

Zuckerberg has had a rocky relationship with Trump over the years, with the president-elect more recently describing Facebook as an “enemy of the people” in a March interview with CNBC. Meta levied a two-year suspension on Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts in 2021 shortly after the company determined that the former president’s actions following the Jan. 6 insurrection in Washington, D.C., could potentially incite more violence.

In 2023, Trump was able to regain access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts, but he also faced some restrictions and potential penalties if he were to violate the company’s community guidelines. Meta eventually removed Trump’s account-related restrictions in July during the lead up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

2025-01-11,I gave PianoVision a one star review on the Meta store in large part because their video shows features without saying they're only available via subscription along with the app pushing that subscription in numerous ways. Am I being too harsh?,"Bought the app over a year ago around Christmas after [someone posted their progress](https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/176xr42/pianovision_appreciation_post_here_i_went_from/) here using the app. Played the virtual keyboard option which was cute but left it alone after that until I got around to buying an electric keyboard. This Christmas I showed the app to my aunt with the virtual keyboard and she loved it which got me to actually buy a keyboard to try it as it's really intended to be used. You will need a keyboard with MIDI output of some fashion to get the full effect. 

Here's the conflict I'm facing: It's a good app when it comes to public domain traditional songs, letting you play your piano in mixed reality with a tune bar floating down like a version of Beat Saber. Honestly feels like you can train from beginning to advance with the app. There are some issues with the user interface, but that might take it for 4 or 5 stars down to 3 or 4 stars, but really what's given in the basic is great and has the potential to be greater. 

The one star review is in part for despite paying $15 or whatever for the app, you're bombarded with the subscription screen. It pops up when you load up. The virtual environment and Ludwig AI icons lead to the subscription. The finger placement generator and sheet music generator in the basic import also are subscription. If you search music, you're given results that'll include many subscription songs. The biggest reason though is the video on the Meta store highlights ALL these subscription locked features without saying this paid app doesn't provide those features without paying $10/month. Further, on the store every reply to the negative reviews seemed to be the developers giving a copy/paste reply.

Joined their discord and informed them of my review in my introduction. Beyond that, I used the app daily and submitted some suggestions that might be useful on the basic part of the app. Today, I received the [developer's reply](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/932108890177425468/1327572732732510319/image.png?ex=67838df4&is=67823c74&hm=db88054b45bf1bec1bb2373193120560af8da2a6c3131180b97162a2311f14b6&) which addressed nothing I mentioned in my review.

The developers replying are Zac and Benjamin which are official responses, while others are likely just fans of the app so should not be taken as official responses. Biggest concern is the developers justifying how they don't mention subscriptions in their video because other apps with subscriptions don't do it either. To me, that's not a good justification. On top of that, one app the developer mentioned was Golf+ which has far better reviews (only 2% of 65,000 reviews are 3 star or lower) despite similar situation of being a paid app with monthly subscription option for more features. 

So, am I being unfair rating their app which I kind of like so low based on how it's advertisement, advertisement in the app itself, and the developers' responses to critiques?",308,136
2025-01-11,What are the most unethical things you could invest in?,"I'm aware of ethical ETFs and managed funds which deliberately rule out investing in companies that are perceived to be unethical.

> Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks Apple “[hasn’t] really invented anything great in a while” and that it has been coasting off of its past success. “Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,” he said this week. Zuckerberg made the statements during a nearly three-hour long podcast with Joe Rogan where, along with discussing Meta’s moderation policy changes and turn against diversity and inclusion policies, they got into Meta’s beef with Apple and its policies.

> The conversation actually started with Rogan’s issues with Apple. Rogan said he’s moving “from Apple to Android” in part because he doesn’t “like being attached to one company.” He also isn’t a fan of Apple’s App Store policies. “The way they do that Apple store, where they charge people 30 percent,” he said. “That seems so insane that they can get away with doing that.” “I have some opinions about this,” Zuckerberg said. While he gives credit to the iPhone as “obviously one of the most important inventions probably of all time,” he argued that Apple has put rules in place that “feel arbitrary.” Zuckerberg said that Apple has “thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way” as Apple’s own products, like the AirPods. If Apple let other people use its protocol, “there would probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there,” Zuckerberg said.

> Down the line, Zuckerberg envisions a world where you’ll be able to use the neural interface wristband and the glasses to text a friend or an AI and have the glasses give you the answer. He also believes that as smart glasses or even contact lenses as a computing platform become more developed, the internet will be “overlaid” on the physical world. “I think we’ll basically be in this wild world where most of the world will be physical, but there will be this increasing amount of virtual objects or people who are beaming in or hologramming into different things to interact in different ways,” he said. “There isn’t a physical world and a digital world anymore,” he added. “We’re in 2025. It’s one world.”",921,460

2025-01-12,Meta won't replace our bricked Quest 3,"FINAL UPDATE: Happy times! We have received the replacement, shipped from the UK without issues.

---

We fell victim of the botched update that ended bricking our 1-year-old Quest 3.

We moved from the EU to the UK a month ago, and because the device was bought in the EU they said they cannot replace it unless we give them an address there.

We take extreme care of all of our devices, we still have our Oculus Rift intact. The Quest 3 is not a cheap device either. I am so frustrated that, without any fault of ours, we now have to go through a whole ordeal of finding someone that would be happy to hold the device for us, sorting out and paying customs fees and flying over to get it or sorting out a courier. The best Meta could do for us was a ""sorry, cannot help bye"". 

At this point we are pretty much thinking about giving up and just keeping a very expensive paperweight that will constantly remind us how useless these companies are and how little they care about their customers.

Apologies, but I needed to vent. Honestly, this is a display of appalling disposition to resolve a major fuck up from Meta


UPDATE: we talked to another customer service rep who told us we could return it from the UK and they would replace it.
We haven't posted it yet but hopefully it'll all be sorted soon ",190,121

2025-01-15,Meta announces 5% cuts in preparation for 'intense year' — Read the internal memo,"Meta is set to cut about 5% of its workforce, focusing on the company’s lowest-performing staffers, CNBC confirmed Tuesday.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg informed employees about the decision to “move out low performers faster” in a memo posted on the company’s internal Workplace forum on Tuesday. Zuckerberg told employees 2025 will “be an intense year.”

The company specified that it is “exiting approximately 5% of our lowest performers” in a separate message posted by a company director. The company has more than 72,000 employees, according to its most recent quarterly report.

Meta said employees affected by the cuts will be notified by Feb. 10 and receive severance in line with what the company has provided previously. The cuts represent Meta’s largest layoffs since the company eliminated 21,000 jobs, or nearly a quarter of its workforce, in 2022 and 2023.

Bloomberg was first to report the cuts, citing an internal memo.

The move follows several major operational changes within Meta aimed at building closer ties with President-elect Donald Trump.

Last week, Zuckerberg announced Meta would end its third-party fact-checking program in favor of a “Community Notes” model used on Elon Musk’s platform X, where individual users provide more context to posts.

“The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech, so we’re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms,” Zuckerberg said in a video announcement.

Below is Zuckeberg’s internal memo, which CNBC obtained:

""Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.

I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle, with the intention of back filling these roles in 2025. We won’t manage out everyone who didn’t meet expectations for the last period if we’re optimistic about their future performance, and for those we do let go, we’ll provide generous severance in line with what we provided with previous cuts. 

We’ll follow up with more guidance for managers ahead of calibrations. People who are impacted will be notified on February 10 or later for those outside the U.S.""

2025-01-20,Thoughts on ticktok ban and how would it impact meta stocks (worth shorting meta stocks?),"It seems like a significant number of TikTok users are growing frustrated with platforms like Facebook and Messenger, with many potentially rage-quitting or deleting these apps altogether. Considering TikTok’s massive user base—about 1 billion globally and 170 million in the U.S.—even a fraction of this shift could create a noticeable impact on Meta.

The question is, how might this trend affect Meta’s stock? On one hand, Meta has faced declines before and adapted through diversification and innovations like Instagram Reels. On the other, losing younger users—key to ad revenue—could hurt them long-term, especially with TikTok growing as a major competitor.

While Meta’s resources and global reach may help cushion the blow, the perception of a mass exodus could still shake investor confidence. Is this a temporary issue Meta can counter, or could it signal a deeper shift in the social media landscape? What do you think?",0,34
2025-01-21,Meta: this sub seems dead and I think both users and mods are at fault,"This will most likely get removed as well. But as a long time contributor on this sub I want to vent a little.

What’s the purpose of this sub? The mod team says we shouldn’t post financial news by itself since they are “low effort posts”, so they are encouraging personal opinions being shared.

But then you have people just asking simple questions, and most of the answers are “just buy index funds” regardless of what the questions are.

Any long-form opinions are either met with dismissive “you have no idea what you are talking about, just by $VOO” or no response at all. 

So we can’t post financial news by themselves, and this isn’t the sub for single stock discussions, and any generic investment discussion just leads to “buy index funds”.

Btw mods, I understand that you guys don’t want “low-effort posts”, but if a post received 300+ upvotes and 200 comments within 3 hours (and many of those comments had efforts put into them), maybe it’s ok to leave it up? It’s not like the front page is full anyway. It’s frustrating to see a thread heating up only for you guys to remove the entire thing. 

Edit: Honestly I’ll just say it: I think the mods are more at fault because their vision of a high quality, high engagement discussion forum with high barrier of entry is simply not achievable on a platform like Reddit without making the sub semi-private with individual vetting process, which takes a ton of work that I’m not sure the mods are willing to spend time on.

I’ve been a mod on a couple super large subs and i fully understand how difficult and thankless the job can be. But my philosophy is that moderators of large subs should be the caretakers instead of gatekeepers. 

There are better places than Reddit for small, closed off communities with high barrier of entry. Let Reddit be Reddit, for better or worse.",1243,306

2025-01-27,"Apple Remains a Threat in AR, Even as Meta and Google Race Ahead",">Meta and Google have jumped out ahead in the race to make augmented reality glasses for consumers, but Apple remains a looming threat. Also: The iPhone maker brings in a fixer for its Siri and AI efforts, and the company has a decision to make about its longtime chairman. Samsung, meanwhile, just unveiled impressive new AI features and is poised to beat Apple to market with a skinny smartphone.

>A decade ago, it began developing AR technology for its now-defunct attempt to build a self-driving vehicle. The idea: a windshield that could overlay navigation information, traffic alerts, camera feeds and other data while the car drove around town on its own. Apple even built a simulator of the concept at its Silicon Valley offices and managed to turn the idea into a working prototype that showed promise to executives.

>But the company quickly realized that this Minority Report-like experience would be too power-hungry and expensive to put inside of a vehicle. So it turned its attention to headsets, which can provide the same data in a smaller package. A person in the car could simply wear some headgear instead of needing to have the technology built into the windshield.

>The car glasses idea didn’t get too far either. But Apple’s vehicle group poured resources into developing AR displays and used virtual reality goggles to demonstrate the car’s capabilities. That ultimately led to Apple’s work on a consumer headset.

>At the time, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook felt that VR goggles were too isolating. He preferred AR, which keeps users in the real world while superimposing data on their field of vision. But it was also clear that the true AR dream — a lightweight pair of glasses that customers could wear all day — was still far off.

>That’s about the time when Mike Rockwell stepped in. That executive, who currently oversees Apple’s Vision Pro division, moved the AR and VR efforts into a team that was separate from the car unit. Rockwell and his staff spent the better part of two years creating a headset prototype that melded VR and AR into an approach that Apple eventually called spatial computing.

>This was the great compromise: Users weren’t truly seeing the real world around them, but the device’s pass-through cameras made it feel like they were. The project was greenlit, and the company eventually spent billions of dollars to develop the device — all while continuing to work on making true AR glasses a reality. That led to the release of the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset a year ago.

>Apple had originally hoped to release AR spectacles as a follow-up to the Vision Pro, but the technical challenges were just too great. Such a product remains far away, and the company is still tinkering with the underlying technologies.

>At the same time, rivals like Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have jumped ahead in the AR race. Meta showed off a prototype of augmented reality glasses last year, and Google is working with Samsung Electronics Co. on their own next-generation devices. Meta also has had success with its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which don’t have a display but can handle tasks like recording video and making phone calls.

>The Vision Pro, meanwhile, has largely been a flop, hurt by its cumbersome design and $3,500 price tag. That said, it’s hard to discount Apple’s innovation abilities. Work on the AR screens remains ongoing at a secretive facility in Santa Clara, California, one town over from the company’s home base in Cupertino.

>Though there were layoffs at the site last year — when Apple scrapped plans for in-house smartwatch displays — the company kept some employees around to work on AR technology, along with a manufacturing facility to develop and test future screens.

>Tepid demand for the Vision Pro has only made Apple more certain that AR glasses are a superior format. But the executives involved in the effort don’t think a product will be ready for three years or more. In the meantime, Apple expects to release other devices in the style of Vision Pro that it hopes will be cheaper and more enticing to consumers.

>While it develops the AR technology for future devices, the company is conducting user studies at its offices to gauge the appeal of features and interfaces. Apple is already working on a version of visionOS — the Vision Pro’s software — that will run on glasses. It’s also exploring other types of wearable products, including a rival to Meta’s Ray-Ban spectacles and even camera-equipped AirPods.

>The question now is whether Apple’s rivals are getting too far ahead. Meta’s AR prototype, called Orion, will set the stage for a consumer product by 2027. And Google’s new Android XR operating system is meant to usher in a wave of headsets and glasses, with Samsung first in line to release devices.

>When I first tested Android XR in December at Google’s headquarters, the company showed me several glasses prototypes — with and without displays. They seemed polished for prototypes, but they won’t hit the market until the display technology improves and costs come down. Another issue to be solved: battery life.

>Meta, Google and Samsung also aren’t slowing down on development of VR and mixed-reality devices. Meta is working on Quest 4 VR goggles, as well as a new high-end model that could eventually become a successor to the Quest Pro mixed-reality headset, I’m told. Samsung, meanwhile, showed off the hardware for its “Moohan” mixed-reality headset during its Unpacked event this past week.

>In interviews, Samsung and Google executives hinted that this headset would be cheaper than the Vision Pro and that it’s on track to debut this year. The companies won’t have to share the spotlight with Apple, which is unlikely to ship any major new head-worn device in 2025.

>But the real showdown will come in the years ahead, when AR glasses are refined enough to serve as a smartphone replacement. You can imagine a future where people use smart spectacles as their primary mobile device and then turn to a mixed-reality or VR headset for gaming or computing tasks. In that vision, head-worn devices will have supplanted both phones and laptops — markets worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

>Given what’s at stake, Apple can’t afford to stay on the sidelines too long. But the company does have a history of swooping into already-established markets and beating competitors with better design and more elegantly integrated hardware and software. The playbook it used so effectively in smartphones and watches could work again.

DeepSeek Shakes Up Stocks as Traders Fear for US Tech Leadership",">Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek rocked global technology stocks Monday, raising questions over America’s technological dominance.

>Buzz grew over the weekend about DeepSeek’s latest AI model being cost-effective while running on reduced-capability chips, casting doubt on the validity of the sky-high valuations for companies like Nvidia Corp. The Chinese firm’s product, released last week, is now at the top of Apple Inc.’s App Store rankings.

>“DeepSeek shows that it is possible to develop powerful AI models that cost less,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. “It can potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain, which is driven by high spending from a small handful of hyperscalers.”

>Founded by quant fund founder Liang Wenfeng, the app’s underlying AI model is widely seen as competitive with OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc.’s latest. Lauded by investor Marc Andreessen as “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs,” DeepSeek’s assistant shows its work and reasoning as it addresses a user’s written query or prompt. Reviews on Apple’s app store and on Alphabet Inc.’s Android Play Store praised that transparency.

>Nasdaq 100 futures tumbled as much as 1.9%, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell as much as 1%. The moves represent continued losses from Friday’s cash session, as US shares cooled after gains earlier in the week as President Donald Trump took office.

>In contrast, stocks advanced in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng Tech Index climbing as much as 2% ahead of Lunar New Year holidays this week. Chinese AI-related stocks including Merit Interactive Co. surged by their daily limits. Merit is among those with the clearest links to DeepSeek after stating in an earlier filing that it had incorporated the homegrown AI firm’s model into marketing.

>Meanwhile, shares in the AI supply chain slumped as investors rethink their assumptions that the most advanced AI will require increasing amounts of computing power and energy. Major Nvidia supplier Advantest Corp., slid as much as 8.6% in Tokyo. Data centers shares also slipped, with Singapore-listed Mapletree Industrial Trust down 3.6%. Markets were closed for holidays in Taiwan and South Korea.

>The DeepSeek product “is deeply problematic for the thesis that the significant capital expenditure and operating expenses that Silicon Valley has incurred is the most appropriate way to approach the AI trend,’ said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer and internet at Singapore-based Aletheia Capital. “It calls into question the massive resources that have been dedicated to AI.”

>Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.com, says the updated AI model unveiled by China’s DeepSeek raises concerns about geopolitical risks as well as questions about US tech stock valuations.

>The decline in Nasdaq futures comes at the start of a big week for earnings from major tech companies including Apple and Microsoft Corp. Profit growth is expected to have slowed while valuations remain inflated, once again causing concern over the large AI-driven rally in the sector.

>The Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 estimated forward earnings, compared with its three-year average of 24 times. Nvidia is at 33 times, though that’s slightly down from its three-year average. Shares of Nvidia were more than 3% lower on the alternative trading system Blue Ocean in Asia morning, according to Kok Hoong Wong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities

>The DeepSeek release raises new doubts, challenging the notion that China’s AI technology is years behind US counterparts. Washington’s trade restrictions had kept the most cutting-edge chips out of China’s hands, but DeepSeek’s model was built using open source technology that is easy to access.

>“While current leaders like Nvidia have a strong foothold, it is a reminder that AI dominance cannot be taken for granted,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. “The emergence of China’s DeepSeek indicates that competition is intensifying, and although it may not pose a significant threat now, future competitors will evolve faster and challenge the established companies more quickly. Earnings this week will be a huge test.”

DeepSeek, an AI startup just over a year old, stirred awe and consternation in Silicon Valley with its breakthrough artificial intelligence model that offered comparable performance to the world’s best chatbots at seemingly a fraction of the cost. Created in China’s Hangzhou, DeepSeek carries far-reaching implications for the global tech industry and supply chain, offering a counterpoint to the widespread belief that the future of AI will require ever-increasing amounts of power and energy to develop.",2503,853

2025-01-28,"Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history","Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.

The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

The selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. 

Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”

The analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”

But after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.

Data center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.

For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.

Nvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.

CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.

The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.

Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.

“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.

Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

Both companies announced big CAPEX spend related to AI for the coming year 2025. Regardless if the amount spent on DeepSeek is true or not, the narrative seems to be that AI may not need as much money as originally thought. 

Both companies' stock were hit in the short term in the past on their plans for big AI spending. These are both good companies but since their earnings are juxtaposed to this risk-off market reaction to DeepSeek, can earnings be positive for MSFT and META?

2025-01-29,Microsoft and OpenAI Probing If DeepSeek-Linked Group Improperly Obtained OpenAI Data,"> Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI are investigating whether data output from OpenAI’s technology was obtained in an unauthorized manner by a group linked to Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek, according to people familiar with the matter.

> Microsoft’s security researchers in the fall observed individuals they believe may be linked to DeepSeek exfiltrating a large amount of data using the OpenAI application programming interface, or API, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Software developers can pay for a license to use the API to integrate OpenAI’s proprietary artificial intelligence models into their own applications.

> Microsoft, an OpenAI technology partner and its largest investor, notified OpenAI of the activity, the people said. Such activity could violate OpenAI’s terms of service or could indicate the group acted to remove OpenAI’s restrictions on how much data they could obtain, the people said.

> DeepSeek earlier this month released a new open-source artificial intelligence model called R1 that can mimic the way humans reason, upending a market dominated by OpenAI and US rivals such as Google and Meta Platforms Inc. The Chinese upstart said R1 rivaled or outperformed leading US developers’ products on a range of industry benchmarks, including for mathematical tasks and general knowledge — and was built for a fraction of the cost. The potential threat to the US firms’ edge in the industry sent technology stocks tied to AI, including Microsoft, Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., tumbling on Monday, erasing a total of almost $1 trillion in market value.

> David Sacks, President Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence czar, said Tuesday there’s “substantial evidence” that DeepSeek leaned on the output of OpenAI’s models to help develop its own technology. In an interview with Fox News, Sacks described a technique called distillation whereby one AI model uses the outputs of another for training purposes to develop similar capabilities.

> “There’s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled knowledge out of OpenAI models and I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this,” Sacks said, without detailing the evidence.

> In a statement responding to Sacks’ comments, OpenAI didn’t directly address his comments about DeepSeek. “We know PRC based companies — and others — are constantly trying to distill the models of leading US AI companies,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in the statement, referring to the People’s Republic of China. “As the leading builder of AI, we engage in countermeasures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models, and believe as we go forward that it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.”",2361,564

[Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) shares were flat after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom.

Here’s how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share**: $8.02 vs. $6.77
* **Revenue**: $48.39 billion vs. $47.04 billion

On a call with analysts, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained some of the rationale for the company’s recent efforts to [improve its relationship](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/11/meta-had-to-bend-the-knee-to-trump-ahead-of-inauguration.html) with President Donald Trump and the current White House administration.

“We now have a US administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning, and that will defend our values and interests abroad, and I am optimistic about the progress and innovation that this can unlock,” Zuckerberg said. “So this is going to be a big year.”

Meta said its first-quarter revenue would be in the range of $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion. The midpoint of that figure trailed analysts’ expectations of first-quarter revenue of $41.73 billion.

Meta’s fourth-quarter sales grew 21% year over year while its net income was $20.84.

The company said that daily active people came in at 3.35 billion in the quarter, up from 3.29 billion the previous quarter. Wall Street was projecting 3.32 billion for the fourth quarter.

Meta said that its first quarter costs and [expenses](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/24/zuckerberg-sets-metas-ai-targets-for-the-year-expects-to-spend-60-billion-on-growth.html) were $25.02 billion, representing a more than 5% increase from the prior year.

Meta reiterated last Friday’s announcement that it would invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 to fuel its AI strategy.

Meta did not provide a revenue outlook for 2025, but investments in the company’s core business “will give us an opportunity to continue delivering strong revenue growth throughout 2025,” finance chief Susan Li said in a statement.

The company expects its total expenses for 2025 to come in between $114 billion to $119 billion, with the bulk of the spending related to its infrastructure costs, Meta said. The company plans to hire workers for infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative artificial intelligence, regulation and compliance.

My analysis:

Earnings were reported on January 29, the 8th day of this streak. They did beat expectations, and beat by a lot. However, CONSECUTIVE multi-day post-earnings streaks historically don’t tend to last, since all information is now public, and some investors choose to take profits. We’re not talking about a post-earnings uptrend that lasts for weeks/months, but CONSECUTIVE GREEN days reacting to the SAME earnings release, with no further news. (Today’s layoffs were also announced weeks ago.)

The other peculiar thing about this stock is it follows a similar chart pattern each day. It tends to rocket up first thing in the morning, followed by a steady mid-day/early afternoon selloff that takes it back to flat or even slightly negative. Then it gets bid up again in the last few hours for a positive close.

[Look at the huge daily morning spikes!](https://preview.redd.it/g0ojl4oodeie1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1038843bea03b4f66c02c66ae3599bb9a17312c2)

Meta Platforms Inc., after pushing into augmented reality and artificial intelligence, has identified its next big bet: AI-powered humanoid robots.

The company is making a significant investment into the category — futuristic robots that can act like humans and assist with physical tasks — and is forming a new team within its Reality Labs hardware division to conduct the work, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Meta plans to work on its own humanoid robot hardware, with an initial focus on household chores. Its bigger ambition is to make the underlying AI, sensors and software for robots that will be manufactured and sold by a range of companies, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative hasn’t been announced.

Meta has started discussing its plan with robotics companies, including Unitree Robotics and Figure AI Inc. At least initially, it doesn’t plan to build a Meta-branded robot — something that could directly rival Tesla Inc.’s Optimus — but it may consider doing so in the future, the people added.

The humanoid effort mirrors exploratory projects at other technology giants, including Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Deepmind division. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

Meta confirmed the creation of the new team to employees Friday, telling them it will be led by Marc Whitten, who resigned as chief executive officer of General Motors Co.’s Cruise self-driving car division earlier this month. He was previously an executive at gaming company Unity Software Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

“The core technologies we’ve already invested in and built across Reality Labs and AI are complementary to developing the advancements needed for robotics,” Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, wrote in a memo reviewed by Bloomberg News. He mentioned the company’s advancements in hand tracking, computing at low bandwidth and always-on sensors.

Meta executives believe that while humanoid robotics companies have made headway in hardware, Meta’s advances in artificial intelligence and data collected from augmented and virtual reality devices could accelerate progress in the nascent industry. Current humanoids are still not useful enough to fold clothes, carry a glass of water, place dishes in a rack for cleaning or conduct other home chores that could get consumers interested in the category.

“We believe that expanding our portfolio to invest in this field will only accrue value to Meta AI and our mixed and augmented reality programs,” Bosworth wrote. Whitten, who will report to Bosworth, will have headcount to hire around 100 engineers this year, one of the people said.

Meta’s goal is to provide what Google’s Android operating system and Qualcomm Inc.’s chips did for the phone industry by building a foundation for the rest of the market.

The software, sensors and computing packages that Meta is already developing for its devices are the same technologies that are needed to power humanoids, according to one of the people involved in the project.

2025-02-19,"If you are not getting immersed inside VR, the problem isn't you, or your brain getting used to VR, it's your Q3. Meta has made a huge downgrade with Q3 but most of us don't know about it.","Edit: since this post got some attention, I need to clarify, that this only affects some people, you probably don't have the issue.  
How to tell? try to look at near objects, play one of the ocean videos from Quest TV, and see if you get a problem looking at near fish, if not then you have no problem with Q3. otherwise, you will feel your eyes are getting crossed and you just can't look at nearby objects. if so then you are damaging your eyes, switch to Q3s. if Q3s still giving you a problem then go with Pico. nothing worth damaging your eyes. 

\---  
  
Grab a coffee and get ready to read this long post,

TLDR: There is a thing I found out about yesterday, it's called binocular overlap, and it's the reason why Q3 isn't impressive for some people. Q3 binocular overlap is very low. binocular overlap is one of the key points to get immersed in VR.

\--  
The long version:

What is binocular overlap?  
The area seen by both eyes simultaneously, allowing for depth perception. A larger overlap improves 3D vision, while a smaller one reduces depth cues

How to simulate low binocular overlap?  
In normal life, your brain takes the data from your eyes with little processing, but once there is a blackspot, your brain will try to fill the gap, you won't see a black spot, but the image won't be real. your perception will change, you will know something is wrong, but you just can't point your finger at the problem.

How to simulate low binocular overlap? Try placing your hand vertically in front of your nose, perpendicular to your face, to separate both of your eyes. You can still see the world in front of you, but now your brain is struggling to merge both images from your eyes, causing eye strain, a loss of depth, and a diminished sense of reality.

\--

For the past few months, I noticed I'm not getting impressed in VR, instead of being inside the scene, it feels like I'm just looking at the scene in stereoscopic 3d, the depth is there but it just can't trick my mind that I'm actually there inside the vr scene.

So here the story begins:  
Yesterday I thought I should check my old Oculus Go and see if it's still working, I had the Jurassic World demo installed, and when I played it, my mind was blown away, I was inside the scene again, it was so easy for me to look around, my eyes were so comfortable even with lower FOV, but that low FOV didn't distract me from being inside the scene unlike Q3. it was so easy to look at near objects too (less than 2 meter/6 feet). with Q3 I try to squint to look at near objects which gives me eye strain.

I thought wait a minute, this can't be right, this device has no IPD at all, how can this be true? maybe my mind is just playing tricks on me? so I went back to my Q3 and installed the same demo, and repeated the test with my Q3, and yep, I can't trick my mind to be inside the scene.

I have a low IPD 60°, I tried putting Q3 to a higher or lower IPD, but that didn't help. with lower I get better depth but my eyes hurt, I just couldn't get the same feeling as Oculus Go.

So after this test, I googled and found multiple posts mentioning the issue, I was losing my mind and I thought It's just me, but looks like this is a big issue that affects some people not all, but most doesn't even realize it, I'm a game dev since 2017, I never knew about this issue, I just thought my mind got used to VR, and I'm not going to get the same old days again when I jump scare from a small scene inside VR, for some people it's a major issue and they even see a black line between two eyes, and others like me it's a minor issue they lose the impressive of being inside the VR scene.

Now I'm a bit sad and happy, I know the problem isn't in my eyes anymore (partially), and there are headsets that could fix this issue I'm having (maybe Q3s)? I don't own that headset yet, but at the same time, I'm really sad since Q3 lens is so awesome and clear, it's a superb headset. there is nothing like it in the market.

My research didn't stop here, I went back and brought some of my headsets from the closet. I wanted to see when did Meta messed up without us realizing it?

I found out that Q2 has a better binocular overlap, unlike Q3.  
I went back to Q1, and this headset still has better binocular overlap than Q3.  
But none had the same feeling as Oculus Go, How can this be right?

Then I thought I should check my Pico 4 ultra, and wow, this headset was the only one that gave me the same feeling as Oculus Go, I'm inside the VR scene again, and my mind believes what I see. but this headset isn't perfect, the air flows inside the champer, which gives you a really bad dry eye.

So now what? we can't fix this issue, it's a hardware flaw, people need to raise this issue to the Meta team so we can get it fixed with their next headset, binocular overlap value got worse with each headset. and VR reviews on youtube need to raise this issue too. there is no point looking at 4K clear image if you are not feeling it.

Going to rank the best headset I've tried that makes you feel inside the VR scene to the worset:  
1- Oculus Go (couldn't find it, but I'm sure its high > 100).  
2- Pico 4 [104.00°](https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/images/PICO4_Native_R90_top.dmx.png) (going to assume it's the same for Pico 4 Ultra).

3- Q1 [84.00°](https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/images/Quest_Native_R72_top.dmx.png) (not sure why this value is low here, I'm going to assume its not accurate. or some other reasons)

As for the below headsets, the head has the worst feeling of being immersed.  
4- Q2 [90.00°](https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/images/Quest2_Native_R72_top.dmx.png)  
5- Q3 [80.00°](https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/images/MetaQuest3_Native_R72_top.dmx.png)

I'm just hoping Meta will release a headset with a pancake lens and a higher binocular overlap.

Some will say Meta had to sacrifice binocular overlap to get a bigger FOV, but that's not true at all, Pico has [122.16°](https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/images/PICO4_Native_R90_over.dmx.png) FOV and a great [104.00°](https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/images/PICO4_Native_R90_top.dmx.png) binocular overlap. so this is something we can get if we ask for.

If you never had an issue with this, then good for you, this is for people who are having issue with, some get eye strain after a few hours without realizing why? then this is probably one of the the reasons, I had to put eye drops every single time I use VR. but not anymore.  
Or probably you never owned a headset with a higher binocular overlap, so you have no idea what you are missing.

My advice here for people who get eye strain, or feel the VR isn't impressed, get Q3s instead of Q3, at least that one has a similar binocular overlap to Q2.

If I had to guess, How does it look like inside the headets?  with Oculus Go you are looking through a square window from your room,  
As for and Pico, you are looking through a circular window from your room,  
As for Q2 and Q3, it feels different, like looking through a binoculars.

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

I think the stock goes to $800 and splits 2 or 3 for 1 and continues to climb higher and raising its dividend.",0,16

2025-02-25,What industries / companies will be durable in 20+ years?,"I am a fan of the long term buy and hold strategy. If the markets high? I buy it. If there’s a dip? I buy even more.

S&P is great, and by being 50+% VOO and a mix of mag 7, I’ve had excellent returns since 2020. With that said, I’m a young investor (27m), and I’d like to plan more intelligently for the long term. 

What industries, or companies, do you all believe will be around and thriving 20-30+ years from now?

For me, I think the culture of “tech” companies will continue to be strong with their hyper efficiency, monopolistic power, and acquisitive nature. So amazon, google, meta and Microsoft, will continue to acquire competitors and dominate all aspects of American life for years to come imo, but there are also dominant monopoly-like players in Walmart and Costco which I also believe will continue to rise and do in the physical world what the tech giants can’t/won’t. In terms of “what we’ll always need” in food, water, shelter, I’m less familiar with players that have the same level of dominance and will last. 

I think energy is the crisis of our time, but I’m hesitant to bet on any individual company at this point. I’m not sure if others have insight, but I’d love to hear arguments not for what matters this year, but what will matter in the longest term.

Thanks in advance for any contributions.

Amazon, Alphabet’s Google and Meta Platforms on Wednesday said they support efforts to at least triple nuclear energy worldwide by 2050.

The tech companies signed a pledge first adopted in December 2023 by more than 20 countries, including the U.S., at the U.N. Climate Change Conference. Financial institutions including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley backed the pledge last year.


The pledge is nonbinding, but highlights the growing support for expanding nuclear power among leading industries, finance and governments.

Amazon, Google and Meta are increasingly important drivers of energy demand in the U.S. as they build out artificial intelligence centers. The tech sector is turning to nuclear power after concluding that renewables alone won’t provide enough reliable power for their energy needs.

Amazon and Google announced investments last October to help launch small nuclear reactors, technology still under development that the industry hopes will reduce the cost and timelines that have plagued new reactor builds in the U.S.

Meta issued a call in December for nuclear developers to submit proposals to help the tech company add up to four gigawatts of new nuclear in the U.S.

The pledge signed Wednesday was led by the World Nuclear Association on the sidelines of the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston.",372,37

2025-03-13,Remembering stock market crash of 2022,"It’s easy to forget how short the market’s memory is.

Still remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.

Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800.

Meta, in particular, was the poster child of despair. Down 75%, from $380 to $88. People genuinely thought it would never recover. The ad market was dying. Reels weren’t making money. Zuckerberg was ""burning billions"" on the metaverse. Investors wanted him to shut it all down.

It wasn’t just Meta. Amazon reported its first unprofitable year after a long time. Google’s ad revenue shrank. Microsoft’s growth slowed. Tesla was down to $113 at its lowest. Institutions were slashing price targets left and right. Investors were selling at the lows, convinced things would only get worse.

And then... the market did what it always does. Slowly, things started improving. Companies adapted. Earnings stabilized. The panic faded. By mid-2023, inflation was cooling. The Fed hinted at pausing rate hikes.

Meta posted a solid earnings report. Then came $40 billion in stock buybacks. The stock doubled. Then doubled again. Amazon recovered. Nvidia went on a historic run. The Nasdaq had its best year in two decades in 2023. By early 2024, Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft were hitting all-time highs to reach even higher by end of 2024. Two years of record gains.

2025-03-14,Remembering stock market crash of 2022,"It’s easy to forget how short the market’s memory is.

Still remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.

Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800. Most investors were convinced this was just the beginning of more pain. Even then people talked about stagflation and going into the lost decade.

2025-03-15,"Why will RDDT not become the next PINS, TWTR, SNAP or other social media company that wasn*t able to grow monetization as fast as expected?","At first I wanna make clear, that I am invested and believe that most of the things discussed in this sub will come true and that this is a great company with a great product which has so much low hanging potential which will be unleashed.

I am a long term investor and I am thinking about the next 2, 5 and 10 years. I have no problem with the volatility.

This is a question of valuation only.

I want to zoom out and focus on the realiy and not possible future scenarios because nobody can see into the future and nothing is 100% sure.

I made a lot of research to understand the stock company and all the potential, but there is one question which I couldn\*t answer myself even tough I did some research on it. This question doesn\*t seem to be discussed here at all.

The only discussion I saw was this one here, where everyone was against the OP and couldn\*t really dissolve his concerns other then ""The future is great because of ....."" (which we all already know and which the market knows) : [https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditIPO/comments/1j81q8o/time\_to\_shreddit\_or\_is\_there\_still\_a\_chance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditIPO/comments/1j81q8o/time_to_shreddit_or_is_there_still_a_chance/)

In this post he describes it well that only because a product and company and the future are great doesn\*t always automaticly mean, that the stock has to go up. I always like to look at overall trends and history. And If I look at all these other social media companies which rely mostly on just ads and have seen high user growth in the past and had a hype are going now side ways. If you just did buy and hold you did make money but these haven\*t been stocks where it just goes up in a straigth line. (can be very volatile, but with constant trend that its a winner stock) They mostly go sideways and have been staying on the same level for years now.

What I mean with winner stock, for example IBKR. They have had a lot of volatility and a lot of downfalls. (If you look back and zoom out it just doesn\*t look like this stock has fallen a lot during some periods)

For me it makes sense to invest more into Reddit if it will become a winner stock like this for example which has huge falls but the sucess is in a long term uptrend.

And yea, I know Reddit is now also making 15% of its revenue with AI deals with Google and OpenAI. This is of course nice and great, but ads will still be the main revenue stream for the next 5 years. The Ai deals are overhyped. Most Ais just keep scraping it and there is almost nothing reddit can do to limit scraping. it will still be cheaper to just scrape it then to make a deal with Reddit unless you are a giant company like Google or ClosedAi chatgpt

And yea, Onlyfans and Patreon paywall content has huge potential and will be great, but most users are still used to not pay for anything on the internet and will also not do so in the next years. Just look at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/)

By the way, the [r/Piracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/) sub has been growing massivly over the past few months. Just recently cracked the 2 Mio subscriber and now already at 2.1 Mio users.

Twitter (before Elon bought it)

Of course you could earn lots of money with Twitter, but only with good timing. For example if you would have bought in 2014 at 45 or even 50, you practicly wouldn\*t have made almost any money. It only went up in the last few years, because Elon bought it. Otherwise it would have stayed down there.

Everyone always says ""Oh, it gotta be at least as much worth as Twitter which was 40 billions"" - But this was only worth that much because of the buyout which many said was way way overpriced. As you can see on this chart Twitter was mostly not worth 40 billions. So this argument sounds good but is lacking.

Twitter has had comparable user amount to Reddit. (not exactly the same, but better then comparison with SNAP)

If I invest in something, then I don\*t want to rely on insanely good timing of buying into and when to take profits. Maybe you buy in cheap but you see the trend of the ricing prises and think ""yea, the future looks great, the product is getting better, more users ...), but you don\*t realize that the stock has become way too overvalued.

Basicly all these Social media stocks crashed after Corona was over.

SNAP

It\*s a bad comparison because there is a logical reason why they can\*t grow ad revenue as reddit can: The users mostly use it for chatting and you don\*t want to have ads in your chat, otherwise you will just switch to whatsapp or instagram or whatever kids use these days.

PINS is now worth $21.66 B. ([https://companiesmarketcap.com/pinterest/marketcap/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/pinterest/marketcap/))

RDDTs Marcet cap is now currently $23.19 B [https://companiesmarketcap.com/reddit/marketcap/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/reddit/marketcap/)

Now RDDT is attractive because it has way more users then PINS and in all the things which already have been discussed a lot way more potential then PINS. The valuation now seems attractive in a comparison. PINS is not in a hype at all, so it should be good for comparisons.

I am not Expert with PINS. I asked several Chatbots to compare these two and what exactly went wrong with Pinterest.

It seems that since 2022 the users growh has been slowing down of the monthly active users. Sounds similar. This has been happening to Reddit recently and will always be a huge danger for shert term price also in the future because of too high growth expectations and hype.

More competition with Tiktok and Instagram for PINS.

Reddit is not directly competing as much with these platforms, so this shouldn\*t be such a huge issue for RDDT. Reddit is more based on Text and like a Forum.

Pinterest is just pictures.

The new ad formats and ad tools which have been introduced by PINS hasn't found as much acceptance by the people who do ad campagnes.

The strategy of PINS now seems to be the integration with e commerce to directly buy the product. This already has been discussed in this sub here and will also be probably done by reddit in the future. (It\*s not a priority according to the recent calls) This e commerce integration seems to take more time then expected.

""**Monetization Challenges**: Despite a substantial user base, Pinterest has struggled to effectively monetize its platform. The company's heavy reliance on advertising revenue makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in advertising spend, especially during economic downturns or shifts in marketing trends.""

""**Pinterest**: As of January 2025, Pinterest's global monthly active users (MAUs) reached 537 million, marking an 11% year-over-year increase."" - I have never know anyone who has ever used that platform, but okay.

The issue also seems to be that Pinterest hasn't been able to attract those big advertisers that constantly run ad campaigns. Reddit is starting to get more of those big names in and already has been sucessful in this (at least to my current knowledge).

Summary of PINS: Similar problem - growth can slow down - more users doesn\*t automaticly translate into more ad revenue per user - diffictulty to compete with big more advanced advertisers like META, Google, Tiktok, Insta.

If I would want to run an ad campaign I probably also would just go to google or Meta because these are know. I guess that most marketing people currently don\*t see Reddit at the same level as an option to run their ads there, because of lacking features out of the perspective of someone who is used to the great suites of Google and Meta. (I am not an expert in this) This is also a chance for Reddit to copy the same things those big guys are doing to make it easier for people to advertise. This must also work about branding.

If you look at companies or organisations, in the last year everyone and their mother has created a tiktok account and started advertising there, because of the hype. Tiktok became a name that became so important, that even as an old person you couldn\*t avoid it. Look at all these politicans posting weird tiktoks. Look at all these companies advertising there, because they hope to profit from the hype. Every institution or politican has a tiktok, insta, even X or nowadays bluesky account. Many even have Threads, but nobody has Reddit. Literally nobody. I know Reddit is a community and not a I follow this guy platform, but this is also a huge reason why not so many people advertise here compared to the big platforms.

\-Reddit has to also become a name you can\*t avoid as an advertiser. I don\*t know how we can get there. Maybe other platforms will get worse and thats why people start advertising more on Reddit for the community and the engagement, because it can be more specific.

So if we break it down to what can\*t happen for the stock to suceed long term:

\-user growth slowing down

\-expected Revenue can't be delivered because more users doesn\*t mean more revenue per user

\-competition with big ad brands (out of the perspective of an advertiser, not of the content platform itself for its users)

\-short term hypes (you buy in when its overvalued and it never ever goes back to this level again)

\-stock going sideways and staying on the same level as Pinterest

!! You had a lot of opportunity cost because you could have also invested in a stock which brings returns!!

I know Reddit is a community and not a I follow this guy platform, but this is also a huge reason why not so many people advertise here compared to the big platforms.

\-Reddit has to also become a name you can\*t avoid as an advertiser. I don\*t know how we can get there. Maybe other platforms will get worse and thats why people start advertising more on Reddit for the community and the engagement, because it can be more specific.

So if we break it down to what can\*t happen for the stock to suceed long term:

\-user growth slowing down

\-expected Revenue can't be delivered because more users doesn\*t mean more revenue per user

\-competition with big ad brands (out of the perspective of an advertiser, not of the content platform itself for its users)

\-short term hypes (you buy in when its overvalued and it never ever goes back to this level again)

\-stock going sideways and staying on the same level as Pinterest

!! You had a lot of opportunity cost because you could have also invested in a stock which brings returns!!

So, I know this is not well structured and too long, but yea, thats what it is.

# Why will RDDT not become the next PINS, TWTR, SNAP or other social media company that wasn*t able to grow monetization as fast as expected and is not a just buy and hold stock until it recovers?

If someone can dissolve this only concern then I want to buy a lot (1/3 of all my money).

2025-03-20,Are we heading into another lost decade?,"In my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j9ygro/remembering_stock_market_crash_of_2022/), I argued that periods of fear during market corrections are often exaggerated and that markets generally recover over time. This sparked a lot of discussion, with valid concerns that this time might actually be different. Interest rates are high. Stock prices seem expensive. There’s talk of recession, tariffs, geopolitical uncertainty, and massive government debt. Investors are rightly asking: **Are we heading for a lost decade?**

So I did some research and sharing my conclusion below. This is based on my understanding, and would appreciate feedback and different perspectives.

For most investors, the thought of spending ten years in a market that goes nowhere is unsettling. But it's entirely possible and has happened before multiple times. Certain eras in market history earned the nickname “lost decade” because stock prices failed to sustainably recover for 10 years or more. The most notable and often cited examples are:

* **Great Depression of 1929:** Stocks collapsed nearly 90%, and the economy fell apart. The market didn’t recover for decades. It took massive government spending during World War II to reignite growth.
* **The Stagflation ‘70s:** Inflation soared past 14%, oil shocks rocked the global economy, and interest rates were pushed up to 20%. The result? Stocks barely moved for a decade, losing purchasing power to inflation.
* **The Dot-Com Bust & Financial Crisis (2000-2010):** First, the dot-com bubble popped, wiping out overvalued tech stocks. Then, just as the market started recovering, the 2008 financial crisis hit, dragging the economy into a deep recession. It took more than a decade for markets to fully recover.
* **Japan’s Lost Decades (1989-Present):** The worst example of all. In the late 1980s, Japan was the hottest economy in the world—until a massive asset bubble popped. Stocks crashed, real estate values collapsed, and economic growth never fully returned. More than 30 years later, Japan’s stock market has just begun to surpass it’s all time high reached in 1989.

# While these periods had different triggers and circumstances, they all shared a few common characteristics:

1. **High stock market valuations at the start.** When investors pay too much for stocks, future returns tend to be disappointing, even if the economy grows.
2. **Debt was excessive.** Whether it was households, corporations, or governments, excessive borrowing created major financial drag.
3. **Big economic disruptions followed.** Inflation in the ‘70s, a financial system breakdown in the 2000s, and deflation in Japan—each one created a decade of stagnation
4. **Government responses often made things worse.** Central banks and policymakers either moved too slowly or responded in ways that prolonged economic pain.
5. **Long-term structural drags slowed recoveries.** Aging populations, slowing workforce growth, and weak productivity made it harder for economies to bounce back.

**Now, let’s compare that to today.**

* **Stock market valuations are high, but not in bubble territory.** The S&P 500’s valuation is elevated, much like before the 2000s lost decade. The current Schiller P/E ratio (price to cyclically adjusted earnings) is well above the historical average. But today’s leading companies—Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta —are highly profitable and are driving real earnings growth, unlike the speculative tech stocks of 2000.
* **Inflation is cooling but remains higher than ideal.** Unlike the 1970s, where inflation spiraled out of control going as high as 14%, today’s price pressures are slowly easing and much more moderate (2.8% as per latest inflation report). Supply chains are improving, and AI-driven productivity gains could help keep costs in check.
* **Debt is a major concern—but it’s not as out of control.** U.S. government debt is at record levels, limiting future stimulus options. But unlike 2008, household and corporate debt are under control. Banks are better capitalized, and there’s no widespread financial system breakdown looming.
* **Geopolitical risks are real, but markets have absorbed them so far.** Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, ongoing wars, and the shift toward deglobalization continue to be key risks.
* **Demographics are a mixed bag.** The U.S. workforce is aging (Avg age. 39), but still younger than Japan during early 2000s (Avg age 48). Immigration and higher workforce participation rates still give the economy more resilience than Japan or Europe.
* **The biggest wildcard is AI and automation.** A hopeful difference today is the pace of technological innovation. The late 1920s had new tech (radio, automobiles) but the Depression cut investment in them. The 1970s paradoxically saw relatively slow productivity growth (despite the IT revolution being on the horizon, its benefits weren’t felt until the 1980s–90s). Today, we’re on the cusp of another tech-driven productivity boom – chiefly due to artificial intelligence and automation. If AI can boost efficiency significantly, it could raise economic growth in the latter part of this decade. Goldman Sachs predicts generative AI could eventually lift GDP by \~7% over a decade. Such a boost would be a stark difference from past lost decades, which generally lacked a positive productivity shock to offset their drags. Right now a lot of it seems hype. But if AI delivers on its promise without displacing jobs at large scale, it can lead to an unprecedented boom and a period of huge wealth creation.

**So while there are risks, this is not the same setup as past lost decades.**

While history never repeats exactly, it does rhyme. Today we see echoes of past pre-crisis extremes – high stock valuations and heavy debts – combined with new challenges like aging demographics and geopolitical shifts. **However, we also see crucial differences: inflation is being actively managed (not runaway as in the ’70s), our financial system (banks and corporates) is more robust than before the 2008 crisis, and potential growth drivers (AI, etc.) could emerge to surprise on the upside**.

Instead of lost decade, **we appear to be headed towards a muddled decade** — some ups, some downs, growth in some specific sectors, and at least some modest growth, even if lower than previous decade.

Of course, this can change as events play out in the world in coming months and years. There may be major natural disasters that disrupt global supply chains or something else. But as things stand now, the more probable outcome is a decade of lower returns than previous decade rather than complete stagnation.

**What does it mean for you?** Investors who expect 10-12% annual returns just through index investing, like in the 2010s, may be disappointed. But those who adapt—focusing on quality companies, dividends, and emerging growth areas like AI—could still emerge out wealthier and stronger.",0,46

2025-03-27,"Meta Investing Thesis: Still Compounding, Still Dominating","Meta has staged one of the most remarkable comebacks in tech history. After being written off in 2022 amid Apple’s privacy changes, TikTok competition, and an uncertain metaverse pivot, the company has bounced back stronger than ever. Its ad engine is running hot again, user engagement is rising, and it's making massive AI infrastructure investments to future-proof the business. With durable moats, expanding monetization surfaces, and strong financial discipline, Meta is no longer just a recovery story — it’s a mature compounding machine with clear upside potential from here.

* **Financial resurgence:** $164.5B revenue (+22% YoY), $62.3B net income (+59%), 42% operating margin, and $52.1B in free cash flow in 2024. ROE stood at \~34%, showcasing strong capital efficiency at scale.
* **Durable moats:** Meta’s 4B+ user base powers an unmatched data advantage. Its AI feedback loop, social graph, multi-surface presence (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), and cross-app identity infrastructure create high switching costs and network effects that competitors can't replicate.
* **AI infrastructure bet:** Meta is investing $60–65B in 2025 to scale its AI infrastructure — including custom silicon (MTIA chips), Llama foundation models, and massive inference-optimized data centers. These are mostly fixed costs, setting up future operating leverage as growth Capex tapers.
* **Next leg of growth:**
   1. **Messaging monetization** — Click-to-Message ads, in-chat commerce, and AI agents on WhatsApp and Instagram
   2. **AI-driven ads** — Automated campaign creation (Advantage+), performance boosts for SMBs and creators
   3. **AR/VR optionality** — Quest 3, smart glasses, and a path toward mass-market AR by 2027. This is more of optionality now. If this works out, can create significant additional revenue. 

* **Valuation (Base Case):** EPS grows to \~$44 by 2029 with steady 10–11% top-line growth. At a 20x multiple, the stock could reach \~$875 → **\~6.9% CAGR from today**.
* **Valuation (Bull Case):** If WhatsApp hits $20B+ revenue and AI tools gain traction, EPS could hit $50 by 2030. At 25x multiple → **$1,250 stock (\~12.6% CAGR)**.

  
In summary, Meta has transformed from a struggling giant in 2022 to a cash-generating, AI-powered compounding machine in 2025. With $62B in profit, 4B users, deep data moats, and massive AI infrastructure bets, it’s positioned for steady, long-term growth across ads and messaging with the Reality Labs optionality. ",0,10

>According to Wynn-Williams, the company now known as Meta worked directly with the Chinese Community Party (CCP) to “undermine U.S. national security and betray American values,” she said.

>Meta told TechCrunch that the arbitration order does not prohibit her from speaking to Congress and that the company does not intend to interfere with her legal rights. The company also said it’s not a secret that it does business in China.

>“Facebook appears to have been willing to provide the data of users in Hong Kong to the Chinese government at a time when pro-democracy protesters were opposing Beijing’s crackdown,” Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said, then asked Wynn-Williams if that is true. She said it is.

>“As part of the censorship tool that was developed, there were virality counters — so any time a piece of content got over 10,000 views, that would automatically trigger it being reviewed by what they called the chief editor,” she said. “What was particularly surprising is that the virality counters were not just installed, but activated in Hong Kong and also in Taiwan.”

>Senator Blumenthal pointed out that Zuckerberg had previously denied under oath that Facebook had built censorship tools to enter the Chinese market.

>Wynn-Williams added that if Meta were to share Chinese user data with the Chinese government, from a technological perspective, she doesn’t think there would be a way to avoid sharing user data from Americans who had interacted with Chinese users.

>She also claimed that Meta had briefed China on developments with various technologies like AI and facial recognition.

>“The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot, and saying he didn’t offer services in China, while he spent the last decade building an 18 billion-dollar business there,” Wynn-Williams said before the Senate.

This could also affect government contracts/AI expansion in the future they're gunning for.

Zuck thought getting buddy-buddy with 🥭(donated $1M to his inauguration, settled a $25M lawsuit, etc.) would help, but nope. Dude spent 10 hours in the hot seat this week, sweating.

Meta definitely won’t sell instagram and WhatsApp it’s such prized asset for them, but would they really pay $18B?

2025-04-20,$ASTS DD The Space Trade will Cum.,"When I first wrote about ASTS [4 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0czbg/dd_asts_a_binary_bet_with_deep_space_value/), it was the first DD on the stock to appear on this subreddit. I told you to dismantle your grandparents porch to sell the top of lumber and buy the stock. I was kinda right but also terribly wrong as you can see in my [gain post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ewg3t9/conviction_or_mental_illness_you_decide_asts/). Now I am older, wiser, richer, and with a hotter wife and better DD. So settle in and learn something. Or don’t, it’s whatever. When you last ignored me there was one key point in the ASTS Investment Thesis:

1) ASTS Wholesale Model gives them access to billions of customers and thereby revenue.

* All Satellite companies (save for SpaceX’s Starlink) have failed because they cannot effectively monetize their service. Technology isn’t a problem, it’s the go-to-market strategy which fails. ASTS has solved this with its wholesale model working with existing telecoms under the FCCs rules for Supplemental Coverage from Space.

* Iridium was one of the most incredible engineering accomplishments in history, everyone who used it loved it. It was the only way calls could be made in NYC on 9/11, the only way to call out of New Orleans in Hurricane Katrina, it’s the first thing every person at the top of Everest reaches for, the list goes on.

* The problem is that Iridium couldn’t sell the service. It was expensive (for the specialized headset and by the minute in its use), people didn’t know it existed (Iridium were engineers not marketers), a market didn’t exist (maritime and remote villages and niche minute by minute sales does not a market make).

   * ASTS solves this with its super wholesale model where AT&T, Verizon, Rakuten, Vodaphone, and others do all the marketing, all the sales, all the billing, and upsell their existing customer base for a service they want anyway (more on this later).

      * ASTS does not need to find customers. Their agreements with the above give them instant access to 3B paying handsets overnight.

      * ASTS does not need to sell the world a new device. Every cell phone just works.

That is the entire story that valued ASTS to its core investors since it started trading as a SPAC. While every single ASTS long term investor lost the love of their wives as the stock cratered to 1.98, the story changed. Five additional pillars have been layered on top of the above original thesis which makes me (and you if you are capable of reading) more bullish. They are as follows:

2) Military Applications Non-Communications Use

* The large array and patented technology have more uses than just communications with cell phones.

   * They can be used as an alternative to GPS, for Missile Tracking, for PNT, and more.

   * Any piece of military equipment that can accept a small wireless chip can use ASTS.

   * The future of war is remote drone operations. They need connection. ASTS does that too.

* ASTS was awarded (through a prime contractor) a United States Space Development Agency (SDA) contract worth $43 million

   * This is for 6 satellites for one year and paid out linearly.

   * Fairwinds advertisement for the service shows ASTS communicating with existing Military Satellites.

   * This award will likely be expanded as more satellites come into service.

* Hybrid Acquisition for proliferated Low-earth Orbit (HALO) program

   * ASTS was awarded a starter contract as their own prime.

   * The program can cover launch and parts costs on top of service payments.

   * End game of this is ASTS use for missile tracking in the “Golden Dome” the Trump administration wants to build out.

3) European Monopoly / Satco Joint Venture with Vodaphone

* ASTS and Vodaphone created a joint venture for all of Europe where they will sell the service to other European Telcos. They will also be offering the service to the European Government much like the company is currently doing in the US.

   * Importantly all the data will be sent and received entirely in the EU. All infrastructure will live in the EU. It will be an entirely European Company to be more marketable in Europe.

* All of this has happened as Elon is nuking his rep in Europe with “roman” salutes and threating to withhold Ukraine’s access to Starlink. People are realizing that Elon is not dependable, and they need alternatives. ASTS is that alternative.

4) The company has begun to acquire Ligado Spectrum to create their own data service which does not rely on the leasing of spectrum from AT&T and Verizon.

* This Ligado spectrum has been unusable in the past due to interference with GPS and military spectrum in nearby bands.

   * Ligado was using this Satellite Spectrum as Terrestrial with FCC waivers unsuccessfully.

   * ASTS brings value to this spectrum through its beam forming which results in no interference.

* Spectrum can be valued on a per mhz per population basis.

   * At .40 - .80 /MHz-pop \* 40 MHZ \* 330M people in the United States we can value this spectrum at \~8Billion dollars.

      * This is the entire Market Cap of ASTS as it stands today.

      * The company is acquiring the exclusive use of this spectrum for far below this cost. (350M + 4.7M penny warrants + 80M / year + small revenue share)

      * The value of spectrum based on previous auctions likely discounts the future value of spectrum based on the number of connected devices we will be seeing in the future. There is more upside than the $8B figure represents (see point 5Bi).

   * ASTS does its own design and manufacturing and is already designing a new satellite to work with its Ligado spectrum.

   * This deal closing will allow ASTS to sell capacity to its partners or offer their own service ala Starlink.

5) AI requires constant connectivity

* [Facebook is spending $10B to put fiber underwater for bigger pipes for their own data](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/29/meta-plans-to-build-a-10b-subsea-cable-spanning-the-world-sources-say/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB9Zn-QxaAgZypcTXZnX7qnT_XW8Gtm4Lo4e7AnQZD3d-HkWV24RLmg0B_RTon33a68Fc4NrzIVFSP-WXsOWjJOjFeE1wLz0KSRP2ZuVXG6ExThE5kmYcSVrb7JhUouBqIV1sWg4g1T-G7jWRobaSH1MIwaH3ANKhUl_xh4xsg7X). That’s all that you need to know about where the biggest companies believe data is going with the introduction of AI. ASTS solves this and blankets the entire earth with data connectivity (albeit with less speed).

   * However, building this giant globe spanning fiber still does not solve the issue of connectivity in the outer reaches of the planet. This is just for the easily accessible areas meaning ASTS still provides value in data delivery which may be of use to companies like Facebook.

* Autonomous AI Agents need connection and backup connections to operate. Data delivery in all corners of the world matters to make use of AI.

* Think of every time you have paid $20 for internet on a plane. You need it access to data too, even if you think AI doesn’t (it does).

   * Consider the number of connected “things” you have now. Airtags, smart watches, phones, laptops, cars, trucks, fucking killer drones from Palmer Lucky, farm equipment, doorbells, your wife’s WiFi Dildo that actually makes her cum unlike you, your WiFi buttplug, etc. All of this adds value to the ability to reliably deliver internet to all corners of the planet. That is ASTS’ market.

6) Space is strategic

* When I first wrote about the company I thought Elon and Bezos were just playing with the new billionaires toy of rockets. It turns out they were just one step ahead of the game. Space is strategic and having access to your own internet is incredibly valuable given the need for constant connection with AI. They know this and are leveraging their launch capacity to build out their own private internet.

* ASTS benefits from an increase in launch capacity by having these billionaires fight for ASTS billions of dollars in launch costs. ASTS can essentially play king maker. Every dollar which goes to Blue Origin isn’t going to SpaceX and vice versa. ASTS future launch cadence with its \~150 launches represents billions in launch costs. They can make the below fight for the lowest cost to get this future business. Note: ASTS already has agreements for 60 launches into the end of 2026. At 20 satellites the company expects to be at cash flow breakeven.

* Don't bet against the below. The Space Trade will come.

   * Elon Musk – Starlink SpaceX

   * Jeff Bezos – Blue Origin New Glenn Kupier

   * Eric Schmidt – Relativity

   * Peter Beck – Rocket Lab

   * Abel Avellan - ASTS

  
Before one of you morons say “waaaaaa but what about starlink?” shut the fuck up and get out of my DD. Thanks. Starlink proper does not speak to cell phones which is why they require end users to have a dish or a mini dish to use their service. Their direct to cell solution with T-Mobile is not purpose built and has failed to deliver simple text messages. Take some time to read reviews of their service. It is complete shit and has no hopes of delivering broadband speed like ASTS without a complete redesign (which is probably difficult given that their lead engineer for D2C just left the company. Not a great look innit?). Alright with that out of the way we can continue. The rest of this writeup I completed for school and is a technical writeup of the company. Enjoy or whatever. There is very little information about the business valuation because I am not smart like that (or in any other way but neither are you). **If you want to know more**, read u/thekookreport ‘s DD [document](https://www.kookreport.com/post/ast-spacemobile-asts-the-mobile-satellite-cellular-network-monopoly-please-find-my-final-comp). ***It is incredible and if you take the time to read it you might have the conviction required to acquire generational wealth. Good luck!*** Anyways here ya go bud:

**Company and Industry Background**

AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) is pioneering direct-to-device satellite connectivity, enabling standard, unmodified smartphones to connect directly to satellites for broadband cellular service. This groundbreaking technology positions ASTS uniquely to deliver global mobile broadband coverage, especially in areas lacking traditional terrestrial infrastructure. Through large, powerful phased-array antennas deployed on satellites in low Earth orbit, ASTS creates ""cell towers in space"" which provide seamless connectivity without the need for specialized satellite phones or additional equipment like satellite dishes.

Globally, approximately 2.6 billion people lack internet access (World Economic Forum), primarily due to economic barriers in deploying terrestrial networks in remote or sparsely populated regions. ASTS addresses this significant digital divide by allowing these individuals to access broadband services using any existing smartphone.

*According to Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (“GSMA”), as of December 31, 2024, approximately 5.8 billion mobile subscribers are constantly moving in and out of coverage, approximately 3.4 billion people have no cellular broadband coverage and approximately 350.0 million people have no connectivity or mobile cellular coverage*.

There are approximately 6.8 Billion smartphones in the world all of which would be compatible with ASTS service on Day 1 without any modifications required as their service purely mimics existing GSMA service. As global connectivity becomes increasingly essential, particularly with the rapid expansion and integration of artificial intelligence, the value of ASTS grows exponentially.

ASTS strategically targets underserved regions in both developed and developing markets, focusing on areas where conventional terrestrial infrastructure is economically impractical or geographically challenging. The company's approach aligns with the FCC's Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) framework (FCC-23-22A1), which outlines the means of providing cell phone coverage from space and necessitates spectrum leasing agreements with established Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). Recognizing this requirement, ASTS has secured strategic investments from industry leaders such as Google, AT&T, Verizon, American Tower, and Vodafone. These investments validate ASTS's technological and business approach, simultaneously offering traditional MNOs a beneficial partnership. Operators like AT&T and Verizon benefit by monetizing their spectrum in otherwise unused regions. This also benefits MNOs and American Tower by effectively hedging their terrestrial tower businesses against the propagation of space-based service and maximizing existing assets and valuable spectrum.

Unlike conventional satellite phone providers or systems such as Starlink and Project Kuiper, which compensate for smaller satellite footprints by relying heavily on extensive ground infrastructure, ASTS's design is distinct. It employs significantly larger satellite antenna arrays, enabling direct communication with regular mobile phones without modifications. The large antennas generate a robust, ""loud"" signal from space, capable of directly reaching unmodified consumer devices—contrasting sharply with traditional satellite phones, which rely on devices actively searching for faint satellite signals. Additionally, ASTS's larger arrays dramatically reduce the total number of satellites needed for global coverage. For instance, while Project Kuiper plans to deploy 3,236 satellites and Starlink already operates over 8,000 satellites, ASTS aims to achieve global coverage with approximately 168 satellites. This not only optimizes efficiency but also addresses growing concerns about orbital congestion and space debris.

The wholesale go-to-market strategy adopted by ASTS leverages existing customer bases from mobile network operators, providing a significant competitive advantage. Unlike previous satellite endeavors, such as Iridium—which faced challenges not with technology but with market adoption due to high costs and complex marketing—ASTS offers a straightforward, accessible solution that integrates seamlessly with existing mobile ecosystems. The model ensures rapid adoption and scalability, delivering reliable broadband service globally without the barriers encountered by traditional satellite communication providers.

To further enhance customer accessibility and peace of mind, ASTS offers flexible pricing options such as day passes and affordable monthly fees, ensuring users remain consistently connected wherever they travel. This model caters to the growing expectation of constant connectivity, as increasingly more devices—including cars, smartwatches, location trackers, and other IoT gadgets—rely on continuous internet access. Consumers regularly demonstrate willingness to pay for reliable connectivity, just think of every time you have paid or considered paying $24.99 for in-flight Wi-Fi.

*In fact, early findings show nearly two-thirds of subscribers are willing to pay extra \[for satellite connectivity\], with about half open to \~$5/month for off-grid connectivity*

**Source(s) of innovation**

When a cell phone initiates a call or sends data, the signal travels through an uplink from the device to the nearest cell tower. At the tower’s base station, this signal is processed and forwarded through a high-capacity connection known as backhaul, typically via fiber-optic cables or microwave links, toward the network core. The network core functions like the network's brain, determining the signal’s destination and routing it accordingly. From the network core, the call or data is directed out through the appropriate aggregation points and backhaul connections toward the recipient’s nearest tower. At this final cell tower, the signal is sent via a downlink directly to the receiving user’s phone, completing the communication.

https://preview.redd.it/p4kc3cr740we1.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe5eb433f21ef132dd8abc60d8216506e65c150b

In contrast, ASTS' approach replaces traditional cell towers and terrestrial backhaul infrastructure with satellites positioned in low Earth orbit. When a phone communicates with AST's BlueBird satellite, the uplink signal travels directly from the user's phone to the satellite itself, acting as a ""tower in space."" The satellite processes and beams the signal back down to strategically located ground gateways that connect to the terrestrial network core, bypassing the extensive network of ground towers and traditional backhaul. The core network then routes the call or data to the recipient, either via terrestrial towers or via another satellite beam. This approach effectively removes geographic barriers, delivering cellular connectivity even in remote or underserved areas where traditional terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable or economically impractical.

https://preview.redd.it/xwbphlj840we1.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=d87b8e32dabc983d52690b9cc247a75357722035

Starlink has recently gained significant attention with its high-profile Super Bowl advertisement showcasing their satellite texting offering with T-Mobile, bringing public awareness to direct-to-device (D2D) connectivity (Mobile World Live). However, despite this increased visibility, Starlink faces inherent technological limitations in its beam-forming capabilities. The satellite's antennas generate broad, flashlight-like beams that cover large geographical areas but lack precision. This approach leads to increased interference with neighboring networks and limits Starlink's ability to efficiently reuse spectrum, ultimately restricting network capacity and data throughput for individual users.

Starlink's beam design contrasts sharply with more advanced D2D satellite systems that utilize precise, narrowly-focused beams to minimize interference and maximize spectrum efficiency. Due to Starlink's broader beam coverage, each satellite can serve fewer distinct user groups simultaneously, which reduces overall service quality and speed per user. As a result, while Starlink's high-profile marketing has drawn consumer attention to satellite-based mobile connectivity, its practical applications remain constrained, particularly in densely populated or interference-sensitive areas where efficient beam management and high throughput are critical.

Comparatively, ASTS employs significantly narrower, laser-focused beams enabled by their large phased-array antennas, as detailed in FCC filings (FCC 20200413-00034). ASTS satellites can generate beams as narrow as less than one degree, precisely targeting coverage areas and significantly reducing interference. In contrast, Starlink’s FCC filings (FCC 1091870146061) indicate beam widths that can span tens or hundreds of kilometers, with antenna gains around 38 dBi, resulting in broader coverage but increased interference and reduced spectral efficiency. ASTS's advanced beam-forming capabilities allow for precise, efficient frequency reuse and higher overall throughput per user, providing a notable advantage over Starlink in both performance and spectrum management.

https://preview.redd.it/xgl7egn940we1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b23b49ff581a6570c470fb5666a6006417d6fd50

https://preview.redd.it/cfcf2mka40we1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=cedc4388c33eef2189cebc720f5327cdf5091649



The top image taken from FCC Filings represents the antenna pattern for ASTS' system, akin to a laser pointer, with a very sharp, narrow central beam and significantly lower sidelobes. This tight focus ensures the energy is highly concentrated, minimizing interference with other areas and maximizing the signal strength in the intended coverage zone. Conversely, the bottom image illustrates Starlink's broader beam pattern, similar to a flashlight, with a wide central lobe and substantial sidelobes. The broader distribution of energy leads to greater interference and less precise coverage, reducing overall network efficiency and limiting the achievable throughput per user.

ASTS innovation is best shown in their extensive patent portfolio some of which protect this signal creation. 

https://preview.redd.it/fzqf4ijb40we1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=2112a61c00314bf51eb1de3a0837501f7067bc96

ASTS utilizes significantly larger satellites featuring advanced phased-array antennas that unfold in orbit, allowing them to generate stronger and more precise signals directly to standard mobile phones. The satellite itself employs a straightforward ""bent pipe"" design, which simply receives signals from phones and redirects them toward ground gateways without complex onboard processing. The sophisticated management of signals is handled by ASTS's proprietary software on the ground, ensuring seamless integration with existing mobile carrier networks and compatibility with current and future mobile technologies (including 6G). We can examine some key patents  from the company to gain a better understanding of their technology advantage:

**Mechanical Deployable Structure for LEO:** This patent covers AST’s deployment mechanism for its large flat satellites​. The satellite’s antenna array is made of many square/rectangular panels (with solar on one side and antennas on the other) hinged together with spring-loaded connectors. These stored-energy hinges (often called spring tapes) automatically unfold the panels into a contiguous flat array once the satellite is in space, without needing motors or power to do the deployment. In essence, the satellite launches compactly folded up, and when it reaches orbit, it pops open on its own like a spring-loaded blanket. This is a core enabler for ASTS business: it allows them to fit a very large antenna into a small launch volume and reliably deploy it in orbit​. The self-deploying design reduces complexity and points of failure (since fewer motors or controls are needed), lowering launch and manufacturing costs. Successfully deploying a massive antenna is critical for AST’s service capability.

https://preview.redd.it/7iewd2jc40we1.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=6561e0f1bf475df91dddb0b405ce48f860b72ad4

**Integrated Antenna Module with Thermal Management:** This patent describes the flat antenna module that integrates solar cells and radio antennas into one structure and includes built-in cooling features​. In simple terms, each panel on ASTS satellite serves as both a power source (via solar cells) and a communication antenna, while also dissipating its own heat. This means the satellite can be made up of many such panels tiled into the huge antenna array above without overheating. This innovation allows ASTS to deploy very large, power-efficient antennas in orbit, enabling stronger signals and broad coverage for mobile users without the weight or complexity of separate cooling systems.

https://preview.redd.it/igtsmgfd40we1.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=46f9469918898ad963dcaab50aa229f2ce8ffdc1

**Dynamic Time Division Duplex (DTDD) for Satellite Networks:** This patent introduces a smart timing controller that manages uplink and downlink signals so they don’t collide when using time-division duplex (TDD) over satellite​. In layman’s terms, because satellites are far away, signals take longer to travel – this system dynamically adjusts when a phone should send vs. receive so that echoes of a transmission don’t interfere with new data. For ASTS, this technology is crucial: it lets standard mobile phones communicate seamlessly with satellites by fine-tuning timing, which improves network reliability and throughput. Without this patent the time between uplink and downlink would result in loss of signal as normal cell signals are not used to the latency experienced in space travel.

**Geolocation of Devices Using Spaceborne Phased Arrays:** This patent outlines a method for pinpointing a phone’s location from space using the satellite’s phased-array antenna​. The satellite first uses its multiple beams to get a rough location (which cell or area the device is in), then refines the device’s position by analyzing Doppler shifts and signal travel time. The satellite can not only talk to your phone but also figure out where you are by how your signal frequency changes (due to motion) and delays, similar to how GPS works but using the communication signal itself.

**Direct GSM Communication via Satellite:** This patent covers a solution that allows standard GSM mobile phones (2G phones) to connect directly to a satellite​. The system involves a satellite with a coverage area divided into cells and a ground infrastructure that includes a feeder link and tracking antenna to manage the connection. A primary processing device communicates with the active users’ phones, and a secondary processor adjusts timing delays for all the beams/cells. This tricks the GSM phones into thinking the satellite is just another cell tower by handling the long signal delay.

https://preview.redd.it/f8er6l9e40we1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=abca83f58c82d29a8223d56ad0a26db503aecf2e

**Network Access Management for Satellite RAN:** This patent describes a method to efficiently handle when a user device first tries to connect to a satellite-based radio network​. The idea is to use a single wide beam from the satellite to watch for any phone requesting access across a large area of many cells. Once a phone’s request is detected in a particular cell, the system then lights up that cell with a focused beam (and can broadcast necessary signals to other inactive cells as needed). Essentially, the satellite first yells “anyone out there?” over a broad area, and when a phone waves back, the satellite switches to a more targeted conversation with that phone’s sector. This on-demand beam switching is business-critical for ASTS: it conserves power and spectrum by not constantly servicing empty regions, allowing one satellite to cover many cells efficiently. It means the network can support more users over a wide area with fewer satellites, lowering operational costs and improving user experience by quickly granting access when someone pops up in a normally quiet zone.

**Satellite MIMO Communication System:** This patent describes a technique for using multiple antennas on both the satellite (or satellites) and the user side to create a MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) link for data​. In simple terms, the base station on the ground can send out multiple distinct radio streams through different satellite beams or even different satellites to a device that has several antennas. By doing so, the end user (if capable, like modern phones with multiple antennas) can receive parallel data streams, boosting throughput.

**Seamless Beam Handover Between Satellites:** This patent deals with handing off a user’s connection from one low-Earth-orbit satellite to the next to avoid dropped calls or data sessions​. It outlines a system where an area on Earth (cell) that is covered by a setting satellite (one moving out of view) is also in view of a rising satellite. The network uses overlapping beams: one satellite’s beam and then the other’s beam cover the same cell during handover. A processing device orchestrates two communication links and switches the user’s session from the first satellite to the second as the first goes over the horizon.

**Types/Patterns of Innovation**

**Initial Testing**

AST began its journey in 2019 with modest yet creative experiment. Their first satellite, BlueWalker 1 (BW1), placed the components of an everyday cell phone into space as a nanosatellite developed in collaboration with NanoAvionics. Instead of the conventional and costly approach—launching a satellite to communicate with ground-based phones, AST reversed this arrangement. They connected a cell phone in orbit with a specialized ground-based satellite (BlueWalker 2). This unusual yet insightful solution significantly reduced the initial costs of launch deployment, enabling rapid and cost-effective R&D. This approach was innovative both economically and operationally, demonstrating practical, real-world viability of their core concept.

https://preview.redd.it/hkwipmdf40we1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5c9f53577d14b69f873d75c4a3e98bfd039c361

**Funding and Expansion**

Early on, the company attracted strategic backing from the telecom industry. In 2020, a Series B round of $110 million was led by Vodafone and Japan’s Rakuten, with participation from Samsung, and American Tower signaling broad industry confidence in AST’s direct-to-phone satellite technology. Importantly, during this time these investors did their own due diligence on the business and verified the work up to this point and the business case. Rather than a traditional IPO, ASTS utilized a SPAC merger to go public: in April 2021 it merged with New Providence Acquisition Corp., raising a total of $462 million in gross proceeds including $230 million from a PIPE investment by Vodafone, Rakuten, and American Tower.

**BlueWalker 3 Satellite**

With SPAC funding secured, ASTS increased their R&D spend to launch a fully functional satellite, BlueWalker 3 (BW3), featuring the largest phased-array antenna ever deployed in space (save for the international space station). The satellite was approximately 700 sq ft, roughly the size of a one-bedroom apartment. BW3 employed Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), enabling in-orbit software upgrades and flexible testing to allow changes not captured with BW1 to be complete after launch. Successful demonstrations of BW3's capability included groundbreaking tests such as the first-ever 5G video call from space to an everyday smartphone in Hawaii, validating their ability to deliver advanced broadband connectivity directly from orbit.

**BlueBird Block 1**

In September 2024, AST took critical steps toward commercialization with the launch of their first commercial satellites BlueBirds 1 through 5 (Space.com). These satellites further tested vital functionalities, including seamless handoffs between satellites, a key requirement for global continuous connectivity. These launches were strategically significant, marking the transition from proof-of-concept to scalable commercial operations. Demonstration video calls were conducted and announced through MNO partners Vodafone, AT&T, and Verizon for testing AST’s technology in real-world networks. These tests were the result of the FCC granting a Special Temporary Authority (STA) to the company. This was particularly significant given its alignment with the broader regulatory landscape under the new FCC commissioner Brendan Carr (Trump Appointed) which shows the regulatory and market acceptance of AST's innovative business model. Further, this removed the Elon Musk sized elephant in the room wherein Starlink was thought to be the only satellite gaining the approval under the new administration.

https://preview.redd.it/eug6ardg40we1.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ae60b0b69faf8b96915df1273f762cef6232861

**Next-Generation ASICs**

AST is also innovating on hardware performance through development of next-generation Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Replacing initial FPGA implementations, these ASIC chips promise a 100x increase in data throughput (as in total data deliverable). This dramatic efficiency improvement increases future satellite capabilities and economic performance, making their network even more attractive for commercial deployment.

**Next-Generation Satellites**

AST’s innovation continues with BlueBird 2 (BB2), a significantly scaled-up satellite design of 2,400 sq ft. Incorporating next-gen ASIC technology, these satellites represent a major leap forward in performance and capability, scheduled to be launched through agreements with Blue Origin, ISRO, and SpaceX. Through increased size and performance from the ASIC, ASTS intends to increase the 30mbps download speed represented by Block 1 to 120 mbps in future iterations of their technology. By the end of 2026, AST aims to have a constellation of approximately 60 satellites in orbit, bolstered by substantial financial backing with over $1 billion in available capital.

**Strategic Spectrum Acquisition**

See above Ligado. At character limit.

**Military and Government Partnerships**

Recognizing strategic opportunities, AST has advanced their military use cases, positioning its technology as a solution for the U.S. Department of Defense and Space Development Agency (SDA). With their satellite constellation able to integrate seamlessly with existing military satellite communication (MILSATCOM) infrastructure AST becomes highly relevant for sensitive government applications such as missile tracking, asset monitoring, and secure communications. A recent $43 million SDA contract further highlights AST’s alignment with national security interests and confirms their technology’s strategic importance.

*As part of the U.S. Space Force, SDA will accelerate delivery of needed space-based capabilities to the joint warfighter to support terrestrial missions through development, fielding, and operation of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.*

**Definition of “Value-added” for the Firm’s Products/Services**

**Resilience in Disaster Response**

One of the most compelling advantages of a space-based cellular network is its resilience during disasters. When hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, or other natural disasters strike, terrestrial infrastructure often fails. Cell towers can be knocked out by storms or burned in wildfires, leaving first responders and affected communities without communication exactly when it’s most needed. ASTS satellite technology adds a crucial layer of redundancy: even if ground towers are down, the network in the sky and a single base station anywhere in the country remains operational. This capability can be life-saving in emergency scenarios.

ASTS has been working closely with AT&T to integrate its system with FirstNet, the dedicated U.S. public safety network for first responders. FirstNet, built by AT&T, provides priority cellular service to police, firefighters, EMTs and other emergency personnel. By extending FirstNet into space, ASTS ensures that first responders stay connected in real time, anywhere. The value added by ASTS in disaster response is clear: persistent coverage when conventional networks fail.

**Cost Efficiency Compared to Subsea Cables**

Building out global internet connectivity has traditionally meant expensive infrastructure projects, such as undersea fiber-optic cables to connect continents. These projects involve enormous capital expenditures and long deployment timelines. ASTS' approach – launching a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites – presents a potentially more flexible and cost-efficient path to worldwide broadband coverage. A rough cost comparison highlights this difference in strategy and scalability. ASTS plans to deploy a complete constellation of 168 satellites to achieve global coverage. Each satellite in AST’s “BlueBird” series is estimated to cost on the order of $20 million to build and launch.

*Brian Graft, Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Anything on the cost per satellite? Has that changed at all? Are you still in that $19,000,000 to $21,000,000 range? Abel Avellan: No. Yes, we’re not changing the guidance on cost per satellite*

https://preview.redd.it/ekodb1pi40we1.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=03caa476262231e043b928ceacdee51a854d05d0

It’s important to note that satellite broadband isn’t a wholesale replacement for fiber in terms of raw capacity – major cables can carry tremendous data volume at very low latency along their fixed routes, which is vital for the core internet backbone. However, from a business strategy perspective, ASTS' satellites offer a more economical way to extend the “last mile” of connectivity to users who would otherwise require huge investment to reach.

**Enabling Always-On Connectivity for Emerging Technologies**

Beyond simply connecting people, ASTS' continuous global coverage unlocks critical opportunities for emerging technologies that depend on uninterrupted internet access. For AI agents and cloud services, constant connectivity is essential. Autonomous robotics, including self-driving cars, drones, and agricultural robots, similarly benefit from AST’s satellite service, ensuring seamless operation even in remote areas beyond traditional cellular coverage.

ASTS competencies are built around its ability to design, manufacture, and deploy large and powerful satellites optimized for direct-to-device (D2D) connectivity. All of which are critical for maximizing signal strength, bandwidth, and data throughput directly to everyday smartphones. AST's expertise in large arrays is particularly advantageous, as bigger (and thereby heavier) arrays translate directly into stronger signals, increased power generation, and significantly improved data speeds to user devices. ASTS requires just 168 large satellites for global coverage, compared to 3,236 for Amazon's Kuiper and over 8,158 for SpaceX's Starlink, this greatly reduces CAPEX, collision risk, launch risk, and replacement costs for AST. With all this in mind, AST benefits greatly from falling launch costs enabled by leading space-launch providers such as Blue Origin and SpaceX. This is best displayed as a year-over-year pricing trend of launch vehicles on a per-kilogram basis:

https://preview.redd.it/4czj2u8q40we1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1dc9937bf0e7f1da432fb69857d50618053670

As launch providers increasingly offer higher-capacity rockets at reduced costs, ASTS uniquely benefits from its strategy of deploying fewer, heavier satellites with large, high-performance antennas rather than numerous smaller satellites. The first successful flight of Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket notably demonstrated its capability to carry up to eight of AST’s Block 2 satellites simultaneously, providing a clear cost advantage. Likewise, SpaceX’s Falcon 9, recognized globally for its reliability and affordability, can accommodate four Block 2 satellites per launch. Additionally, the progress on SpaceX’s Starship program offers further promise, potentially unlocking even greater launch capacities at lower costs.

AST's operational competencies are further strengthened by its vertical integration.

*Approximately 95% vertically integrated for manufacturing of satellite components and subsystems, for which we own or license the IP and control the manufacturing process*.

By controlling its own production processes and intellectual property, AST not only reduces dependency on external suppliers—mitigating geopolitical and supply-chain risks—but also achieves superior cost efficiencies and quality control. This vertical integration is crucial at a time when the United States is prioritizing domestic capability in strategic industries like space technology, positioning AST favorably to benefit from increasing governmental support and protective policies.

The company's production strategy is robust and ambitious, with AST targeting a monthly production rate of six satellites at its Texas factory. This consistent cadence enables rapid scaling and timely replacement of satellites, ensuring continuous, reliable service for customers. Given rising geopolitical tensions, particularly concerning competition with China in space exploration and technology, AST's fully integrated, U.S.-based manufacturing operation places it strategically to capitalize on potential government partnerships or contracts aimed at strengthening domestic space capabilities.

**Organizational Structure/Culture/Leadership**

This section was about the leadership team of the company. It is just regurgitated from their own website and is not really valuable. Here is all you need to know: the CEO Abel Avellan is a certified bad ass. He has had a successful exit from his first company EMC and used that cash to fund this company. He takes no salary, he doesn’t have a crazy stock based compensation that he extracts with, he is just a good dude who is aligned with the company and its investors. He doesn’t spend his day on twitter trying to impregnate Tiffany Fong. He has not lied about his ability to play Diablo or PoE2. We like Abel. You should too.

2025-04-20,The era of American stock market exceptionalism is over,"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/american-exceptionalism-over/?ICID=continue_without_subscribing_reg_first

Nearly three quarters of fund managers think that US exceptionalism has peaked. The prevailing trend of the last decade – a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions – is over, according to the Bank of America’s latest survey.
Over the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trump’s tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated.

While it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isn’t the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets.
Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall – a scenario today’s US market is particularly vulnerable to.
One of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed.

Since 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc – over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively.

Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: “Technology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.”
However, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&P 500 has narrowed of late. A year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the US market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. That is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026.

The upset is apparent in other metrics, too. While the Magnificent Seven accounted for 50pc of the S&P 500’s earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025.

All of this adds up to a simple fact: US equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past.
In fact, Mr Stevenson warns they may underperform.
Markets are also becoming suspicious of US government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market.
Mr Gimber explains: “One of the big parts behind the US economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running.
“This has been an expansion built on US government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of US government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.”

2025-04-21,$ASTS DD The Space Trade will Cum.,"When I first wrote about ASTS [4 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0czbg/dd_asts_a_binary_bet_with_deep_space_value/), it was the first DD on the stock to appear on this subreddit. I told you to dismantle your grandparents porch to sell the top of lumber and buy the stock. I was kinda right but also terribly wrong as you can see in my [gain post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ewg3t9/conviction_or_mental_illness_you_decide_asts/). Now I am older, wiser, richer, and with a hotter wife and better DD. So settle in and learn something. Or don’t, it’s whatever. When you last ignored me there was one key point in the ASTS Investment Thesis:

1) ASTS Wholesale Model gives them access to billions of customers and thereby revenue.

* All Satellite companies (save for SpaceX’s Starlink) have failed because they cannot effectively monetize their service. Technology isn’t a problem, it’s the go-to-market strategy which fails. ASTS has solved this with its wholesale model working with existing telecoms under the FCCs rules for Supplemental Coverage from Space.

* Iridium was one of the most incredible engineering accomplishments in history, everyone who used it loved it. It was the only way calls could be made in NYC on 9/11, the only way to call out of New Orleans in Hurricane Katrina, it’s the first thing every person at the top of Everest reaches for, the list goes on.

* The problem is that Iridium couldn’t sell the service. It was expensive (for the specialized headset and by the minute in its use), people didn’t know it existed (Iridium were engineers not marketers), a market didn’t exist (maritime and remote villages and niche minute by minute sales does not a market make).

   * ASTS solves this with its super wholesale model where AT&T, Verizon, Rakuten, Vodaphone, and others do all the marketing, all the sales, all the billing, and upsell their existing customer base for a service they want anyway (more on this later).

      * ASTS does not need to find customers. Their agreements with the above give them instant access to 3B paying handsets overnight.

      * ASTS does not need to sell the world a new device. Every cell phone just works.

That is the entire story that valued ASTS to its core investors since it started trading as a SPAC. While every single ASTS long term investor lost the love of their wives as the stock cratered to 1.98, the story changed. Five additional pillars have been layered on top of the above original thesis which makes me (and you if you are capable of reading) more bullish. They are as follows:

2) Military Applications Non-Communications Use

* The large array and patented technology have more uses than just communications with cell phones.

   * They can be used as an alternative to GPS, for Missile Tracking, for PNT, and more.

   * Any piece of military equipment that can accept a small wireless chip can use ASTS.

   * The future of war is remote drone operations. They need connection. ASTS does that too.

* ASTS was awarded (through a prime contractor) a United States Space Development Agency (SDA) contract worth $43 million

   * This is for 6 satellites for one year and paid out linearly.

   * Fairwinds advertisement for the service shows ASTS communicating with existing Military Satellites.

   * This award will likely be expanded as more satellites come into service.

* Hybrid Acquisition for proliferated Low-earth Orbit (HALO) program

   * ASTS was awarded a starter contract as their own prime.

   * The program can cover launch and parts costs on top of service payments.

   * End game of this is ASTS use for missile tracking in the “Golden Dome” the Trump administration wants to build out.

3) European Monopoly / Satco Joint Venture with Vodaphone

* ASTS and Vodaphone created a joint venture for all of Europe where they will sell the service to other European Telcos. They will also be offering the service to the European Government much like the company is currently doing in the US.

   * Importantly all the data will be sent and received entirely in the EU. All infrastructure will live in the EU. It will be an entirely European Company to be more marketable in Europe.

* All of this has happened as Elon is nuking his rep in Europe with “roman” salutes and threating to withhold Ukraine’s access to Starlink. People are realizing that Elon is not dependable, and they need alternatives. ASTS is that alternative.

4) The company has begun to acquire Ligado Spectrum to create their own data service which does not rely on the leasing of spectrum from AT&T and Verizon.

* This Ligado spectrum has been unusable in the past due to interference with GPS and military spectrum in nearby bands.

   * Ligado was using this Satellite Spectrum as Terrestrial with FCC waivers unsuccessfully.

   * ASTS brings value to this spectrum through its beam forming which results in no interference.

* Spectrum can be valued on a per mhz per population basis.

   * At .40 - .80 /MHz-pop \* 40 MHZ \* 330M people in the United States we can value this spectrum at \~8Billion dollars.

      * This is the entire Market Cap of ASTS as it stands today.

      * The company is acquiring the exclusive use of this spectrum for far below this cost. (350M + 4.7M penny warrants + 80M / year + small revenue share)

      * The value of spectrum based on previous auctions likely discounts the future value of spectrum based on the number of connected devices we will be seeing in the future. There is more upside than the $8B figure represents (see point 5Bi).

   * ASTS does its own design and manufacturing and is already designing a new satellite to work with its Ligado spectrum.

   * This deal closing will allow ASTS to sell capacity to its partners or offer their own service ala Starlink.

5) AI requires constant connectivity

* [Facebook is spending $10B to put fiber underwater for bigger pipes for their own data](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/29/meta-plans-to-build-a-10b-subsea-cable-spanning-the-world-sources-say/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB9Zn-QxaAgZypcTXZnX7qnT_XW8Gtm4Lo4e7AnQZD3d-HkWV24RLmg0B_RTon33a68Fc4NrzIVFSP-WXsOWjJOjFeE1wLz0KSRP2ZuVXG6ExThE5kmYcSVrb7JhUouBqIV1sWg4g1T-G7jWRobaSH1MIwaH3ANKhUl_xh4xsg7X). That’s all that you need to know about where the biggest companies believe data is going with the introduction of AI. ASTS solves this and blankets the entire earth with data connectivity (albeit with less speed).

   * However, building this giant globe spanning fiber still does not solve the issue of connectivity in the outer reaches of the planet. This is just for the easily accessible areas meaning ASTS still provides value in data delivery which may be of use to companies like Facebook.

* Autonomous AI Agents need connection and backup connections to operate. Data delivery in all corners of the world matters to make use of AI.

* Think of every time you have paid $20 for internet on a plane. You need it access to data too, even if you think AI doesn’t (it does).

   * Consider the number of connected “things” you have now. Airtags, smart watches, phones, laptops, cars, trucks, fucking killer drones from Palmer Lucky, farm equipment, doorbells, your wife’s WiFi Dildo that actually makes her cum unlike you, your WiFi buttplug, etc. All of this adds value to the ability to reliably deliver internet to all corners of the planet. That is ASTS’ market.

6) Space is strategic

* When I first wrote about the company I thought Elon and Bezos were just playing with the new billionaires toy of rockets. It turns out they were just one step ahead of the game. Space is strategic and having access to your own internet is incredibly valuable given the need for constant connection with AI. They know this and are leveraging their launch capacity to build out their own private internet.

* ASTS benefits from an increase in launch capacity by having these billionaires fight for ASTS billions of dollars in launch costs. ASTS can essentially play king maker. Every dollar which goes to Blue Origin isn’t going to SpaceX and vice versa. ASTS future launch cadence with its \~150 launches represents billions in launch costs. They can make the below fight for the lowest cost to get this future business. Note: ASTS already has agreements for 60 launches into the end of 2026. At 20 satellites the company expects to be at cash flow breakeven.

* Don't bet against the below. The Space Trade will come.

   * Elon Musk – Starlink SpaceX

   * Jeff Bezos – Blue Origin New Glenn Kupier

   * Eric Schmidt – Relativity

   * Peter Beck – Rocket Lab

   * Abel Avellan - ASTS

  
Before one of you morons say “waaaaaa but what about starlink?” shut the fuck up and get out of my DD. Thanks. Starlink proper does not speak to cell phones which is why they require end users to have a dish or a mini dish to use their service. Their direct to cell solution with T-Mobile is not purpose built and has failed to deliver simple text messages. Take some time to read reviews of their service. It is complete shit and has no hopes of delivering broadband speed like ASTS without a complete redesign (which is probably difficult given that their lead engineer for D2C just left the company. Not a great look innit?). Alright with that out of the way we can continue. The rest of this writeup I completed for school and is a technical writeup of the company. Enjoy or whatever. There is very little information about the business valuation because I am not smart like that (or in any other way but neither are you). **If you want to know more**, read u/thekookreport ‘s DD [document](https://www.kookreport.com/post/ast-spacemobile-asts-the-mobile-satellite-cellular-network-monopoly-please-find-my-final-comp). ***It is incredible and if you take the time to read it you might have the conviction required to acquire generational wealth. Good luck!*** Anyways here ya go bud:

**Company and Industry Background**

AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) is pioneering direct-to-device satellite connectivity, enabling standard, unmodified smartphones to connect directly to satellites for broadband cellular service. This groundbreaking technology positions ASTS uniquely to deliver global mobile broadband coverage, especially in areas lacking traditional terrestrial infrastructure. Through large, powerful phased-array antennas deployed on satellites in low Earth orbit, ASTS creates ""cell towers in space"" which provide seamless connectivity without the need for specialized satellite phones or additional equipment like satellite dishes.

Globally, approximately 2.6 billion people lack internet access (World Economic Forum), primarily due to economic barriers in deploying terrestrial networks in remote or sparsely populated regions. ASTS addresses this significant digital divide by allowing these individuals to access broadband services using any existing smartphone.

*According to Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (“GSMA”), as of December 31, 2024, approximately 5.8 billion mobile subscribers are constantly moving in and out of coverage, approximately 3.4 billion people have no cellular broadband coverage and approximately 350.0 million people have no connectivity or mobile cellular coverage*.

There are approximately 6.8 Billion smartphones in the world all of which would be compatible with ASTS service on Day 1 without any modifications required as their service purely mimics existing GSMA service. As global connectivity becomes increasingly essential, particularly with the rapid expansion and integration of artificial intelligence, the value of ASTS grows exponentially.

ASTS strategically targets underserved regions in both developed and developing markets, focusing on areas where conventional terrestrial infrastructure is economically impractical or geographically challenging. The company's approach aligns with the FCC's Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) framework (FCC-23-22A1), which outlines the means of providing cell phone coverage from space and necessitates spectrum leasing agreements with established Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). Recognizing this requirement, ASTS has secured strategic investments from industry leaders such as Google, AT&T, Verizon, American Tower, and Vodafone. These investments validate ASTS's technological and business approach, simultaneously offering traditional MNOs a beneficial partnership. Operators like AT&T and Verizon benefit by monetizing their spectrum in otherwise unused regions. This also benefits MNOs and American Tower by effectively hedging their terrestrial tower businesses against the propagation of space-based service and maximizing existing assets and valuable spectrum.

Unlike conventional satellite phone providers or systems such as Starlink and Project Kuiper, which compensate for smaller satellite footprints by relying heavily on extensive ground infrastructure, ASTS's design is distinct. It employs significantly larger satellite antenna arrays, enabling direct communication with regular mobile phones without modifications. The large antennas generate a robust, ""loud"" signal from space, capable of directly reaching unmodified consumer devices—contrasting sharply with traditional satellite phones, which rely on devices actively searching for faint satellite signals. Additionally, ASTS's larger arrays dramatically reduce the total number of satellites needed for global coverage. For instance, while Project Kuiper plans to deploy 3,236 satellites and Starlink already operates over 8,000 satellites, ASTS aims to achieve global coverage with approximately 168 satellites. This not only optimizes efficiency but also addresses growing concerns about orbital congestion and space debris.

The wholesale go-to-market strategy adopted by ASTS leverages existing customer bases from mobile network operators, providing a significant competitive advantage. Unlike previous satellite endeavors, such as Iridium—which faced challenges not with technology but with market adoption due to high costs and complex marketing—ASTS offers a straightforward, accessible solution that integrates seamlessly with existing mobile ecosystems. The model ensures rapid adoption and scalability, delivering reliable broadband service globally without the barriers encountered by traditional satellite communication providers.

To further enhance customer accessibility and peace of mind, ASTS offers flexible pricing options such as day passes and affordable monthly fees, ensuring users remain consistently connected wherever they travel. This model caters to the growing expectation of constant connectivity, as increasingly more devices—including cars, smartwatches, location trackers, and other IoT gadgets—rely on continuous internet access. Consumers regularly demonstrate willingness to pay for reliable connectivity, just think of every time you have paid or considered paying $24.99 for in-flight Wi-Fi.

*In fact, early findings show nearly two-thirds of subscribers are willing to pay extra \[for satellite connectivity\], with about half open to \~$5/month for off-grid connectivity*

**Source(s) of innovation**

When a cell phone initiates a call or sends data, the signal travels through an uplink from the device to the nearest cell tower. At the tower’s base station, this signal is processed and forwarded through a high-capacity connection known as backhaul, typically via fiber-optic cables or microwave links, toward the network core. The network core functions like the network's brain, determining the signal’s destination and routing it accordingly. From the network core, the call or data is directed out through the appropriate aggregation points and backhaul connections toward the recipient’s nearest tower. At this final cell tower, the signal is sent via a downlink directly to the receiving user’s phone, completing the communication.

https://preview.redd.it/p4kc3cr740we1.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe5eb433f21ef132dd8abc60d8216506e65c150b

In contrast, ASTS' approach replaces traditional cell towers and terrestrial backhaul infrastructure with satellites positioned in low Earth orbit. When a phone communicates with AST's BlueBird satellite, the uplink signal travels directly from the user's phone to the satellite itself, acting as a ""tower in space."" The satellite processes and beams the signal back down to strategically located ground gateways that connect to the terrestrial network core, bypassing the extensive network of ground towers and traditional backhaul. The core network then routes the call or data to the recipient, either via terrestrial towers or via another satellite beam. This approach effectively removes geographic barriers, delivering cellular connectivity even in remote or underserved areas where traditional terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable or economically impractical.

https://preview.redd.it/xwbphlj840we1.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=d87b8e32dabc983d52690b9cc247a75357722035

Starlink has recently gained significant attention with its high-profile Super Bowl advertisement showcasing their satellite texting offering with T-Mobile, bringing public awareness to direct-to-device (D2D) connectivity (Mobile World Live). However, despite this increased visibility, Starlink faces inherent technological limitations in its beam-forming capabilities. The satellite's antennas generate broad, flashlight-like beams that cover large geographical areas but lack precision. This approach leads to increased interference with neighboring networks and limits Starlink's ability to efficiently reuse spectrum, ultimately restricting network capacity and data throughput for individual users.

Starlink's beam design contrasts sharply with more advanced D2D satellite systems that utilize precise, narrowly-focused beams to minimize interference and maximize spectrum efficiency. Due to Starlink's broader beam coverage, each satellite can serve fewer distinct user groups simultaneously, which reduces overall service quality and speed per user. As a result, while Starlink's high-profile marketing has drawn consumer attention to satellite-based mobile connectivity, its practical applications remain constrained, particularly in densely populated or interference-sensitive areas where efficient beam management and high throughput are critical.

Comparatively, ASTS employs significantly narrower, laser-focused beams enabled by their large phased-array antennas, as detailed in FCC filings (FCC 20200413-00034). ASTS satellites can generate beams as narrow as less than one degree, precisely targeting coverage areas and significantly reducing interference. In contrast, Starlink’s FCC filings (FCC 1091870146061) indicate beam widths that can span tens or hundreds of kilometers, with antenna gains around 38 dBi, resulting in broader coverage but increased interference and reduced spectral efficiency. ASTS's advanced beam-forming capabilities allow for precise, efficient frequency reuse and higher overall throughput per user, providing a notable advantage over Starlink in both performance and spectrum management.

https://preview.redd.it/xgl7egn940we1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b23b49ff581a6570c470fb5666a6006417d6fd50

https://preview.redd.it/cfcf2mka40we1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=cedc4388c33eef2189cebc720f5327cdf5091649



The top image taken from FCC Filings represents the antenna pattern for ASTS' system, akin to a laser pointer, with a very sharp, narrow central beam and significantly lower sidelobes. This tight focus ensures the energy is highly concentrated, minimizing interference with other areas and maximizing the signal strength in the intended coverage zone. Conversely, the bottom image illustrates Starlink's broader beam pattern, similar to a flashlight, with a wide central lobe and substantial sidelobes. The broader distribution of energy leads to greater interference and less precise coverage, reducing overall network efficiency and limiting the achievable throughput per user.

ASTS innovation is best shown in their extensive patent portfolio some of which protect this signal creation. 

https://preview.redd.it/fzqf4ijb40we1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=2112a61c00314bf51eb1de3a0837501f7067bc96

ASTS utilizes significantly larger satellites featuring advanced phased-array antennas that unfold in orbit, allowing them to generate stronger and more precise signals directly to standard mobile phones. The satellite itself employs a straightforward ""bent pipe"" design, which simply receives signals from phones and redirects them toward ground gateways without complex onboard processing. The sophisticated management of signals is handled by ASTS's proprietary software on the ground, ensuring seamless integration with existing mobile carrier networks and compatibility with current and future mobile technologies (including 6G). We can examine some key patents  from the company to gain a better understanding of their technology advantage:

**Mechanical Deployable Structure for LEO:** This patent covers AST’s deployment mechanism for its large flat satellites​. The satellite’s antenna array is made of many square/rectangular panels (with solar on one side and antennas on the other) hinged together with spring-loaded connectors. These stored-energy hinges (often called spring tapes) automatically unfold the panels into a contiguous flat array once the satellite is in space, without needing motors or power to do the deployment. In essence, the satellite launches compactly folded up, and when it reaches orbit, it pops open on its own like a spring-loaded blanket. This is a core enabler for ASTS business: it allows them to fit a very large antenna into a small launch volume and reliably deploy it in orbit​. The self-deploying design reduces complexity and points of failure (since fewer motors or controls are needed), lowering launch and manufacturing costs. Successfully deploying a massive antenna is critical for AST’s service capability.

https://preview.redd.it/7iewd2jc40we1.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=6561e0f1bf475df91dddb0b405ce48f860b72ad4

**Integrated Antenna Module with Thermal Management:** This patent describes the flat antenna module that integrates solar cells and radio antennas into one structure and includes built-in cooling features​. In simple terms, each panel on ASTS satellite serves as both a power source (via solar cells) and a communication antenna, while also dissipating its own heat. This means the satellite can be made up of many such panels tiled into the huge antenna array above without overheating. This innovation allows ASTS to deploy very large, power-efficient antennas in orbit, enabling stronger signals and broad coverage for mobile users without the weight or complexity of separate cooling systems.

https://preview.redd.it/igtsmgfd40we1.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=46f9469918898ad963dcaab50aa229f2ce8ffdc1

**Dynamic Time Division Duplex (DTDD) for Satellite Networks:** This patent introduces a smart timing controller that manages uplink and downlink signals so they don’t collide when using time-division duplex (TDD) over satellite​. In layman’s terms, because satellites are far away, signals take longer to travel – this system dynamically adjusts when a phone should send vs. receive so that echoes of a transmission don’t interfere with new data. For ASTS, this technology is crucial: it lets standard mobile phones communicate seamlessly with satellites by fine-tuning timing, which improves network reliability and throughput. Without this patent the time between uplink and downlink would result in loss of signal as normal cell signals are not used to the latency experienced in space travel.

**Geolocation of Devices Using Spaceborne Phased Arrays:** This patent outlines a method for pinpointing a phone’s location from space using the satellite’s phased-array antenna​. The satellite first uses its multiple beams to get a rough location (which cell or area the device is in), then refines the device’s position by analyzing Doppler shifts and signal travel time. The satellite can not only talk to your phone but also figure out where you are by how your signal frequency changes (due to motion) and delays, similar to how GPS works but using the communication signal itself.

**Direct GSM Communication via Satellite:** This patent covers a solution that allows standard GSM mobile phones (2G phones) to connect directly to a satellite​. The system involves a satellite with a coverage area divided into cells and a ground infrastructure that includes a feeder link and tracking antenna to manage the connection. A primary processing device communicates with the active users’ phones, and a secondary processor adjusts timing delays for all the beams/cells. This tricks the GSM phones into thinking the satellite is just another cell tower by handling the long signal delay.

https://preview.redd.it/f8er6l9e40we1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=abca83f58c82d29a8223d56ad0a26db503aecf2e

**Network Access Management for Satellite RAN:** This patent describes a method to efficiently handle when a user device first tries to connect to a satellite-based radio network​. The idea is to use a single wide beam from the satellite to watch for any phone requesting access across a large area of many cells. Once a phone’s request is detected in a particular cell, the system then lights up that cell with a focused beam (and can broadcast necessary signals to other inactive cells as needed). Essentially, the satellite first yells “anyone out there?” over a broad area, and when a phone waves back, the satellite switches to a more targeted conversation with that phone’s sector. This on-demand beam switching is business-critical for ASTS: it conserves power and spectrum by not constantly servicing empty regions, allowing one satellite to cover many cells efficiently. It means the network can support more users over a wide area with fewer satellites, lowering operational costs and improving user experience by quickly granting access when someone pops up in a normally quiet zone.

**Satellite MIMO Communication System:** This patent describes a technique for using multiple antennas on both the satellite (or satellites) and the user side to create a MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) link for data​. In simple terms, the base station on the ground can send out multiple distinct radio streams through different satellite beams or even different satellites to a device that has several antennas. By doing so, the end user (if capable, like modern phones with multiple antennas) can receive parallel data streams, boosting throughput.

**Seamless Beam Handover Between Satellites:** This patent deals with handing off a user’s connection from one low-Earth-orbit satellite to the next to avoid dropped calls or data sessions​. It outlines a system where an area on Earth (cell) that is covered by a setting satellite (one moving out of view) is also in view of a rising satellite. The network uses overlapping beams: one satellite’s beam and then the other’s beam cover the same cell during handover. A processing device orchestrates two communication links and switches the user’s session from the first satellite to the second as the first goes over the horizon.

**Types/Patterns of Innovation**

**Initial Testing**

AST began its journey in 2019 with modest yet creative experiment. Their first satellite, BlueWalker 1 (BW1), placed the components of an everyday cell phone into space as a nanosatellite developed in collaboration with NanoAvionics. Instead of the conventional and costly approach—launching a satellite to communicate with ground-based phones, AST reversed this arrangement. They connected a cell phone in orbit with a specialized ground-based satellite (BlueWalker 2). This unusual yet insightful solution significantly reduced the initial costs of launch deployment, enabling rapid and cost-effective R&D. This approach was innovative both economically and operationally, demonstrating practical, real-world viability of their core concept.

**Funding and Expansion**

Early on, the company attracted strategic backing from the telecom industry. In 2020, a Series B round of $110 million was led by Vodafone and Japan’s Rakuten, with participation from Samsung, and American Tower signaling broad industry confidence in AST’s direct-to-phone satellite technology. Importantly, during this time these investors did their own due diligence on the business and verified the work up to this point and the business case. Rather than a traditional IPO, ASTS utilized a SPAC merger to go public: in April 2021 it merged with New Providence Acquisition Corp., raising a total of $462 million in gross proceeds including $230 million from a PIPE investment by Vodafone, Rakuten, and American Tower.

**BlueWalker 3 Satellite**

With SPAC funding secured, ASTS increased their R&D spend to launch a fully functional satellite, BlueWalker 3 (BW3), featuring the largest phased-array antenna ever deployed in space (save for the international space station). The satellite was approximately 700 sq ft, roughly the size of a one-bedroom apartment. BW3 employed Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), enabling in-orbit software upgrades and flexible testing to allow changes not captured with BW1 to be complete after launch. Successful demonstrations of BW3's capability included groundbreaking tests such as the first-ever 5G video call from space to an everyday smartphone in Hawaii, validating their ability to deliver advanced broadband connectivity directly from orbit.

**BlueBird Block 1**

In September 2024, AST took critical steps toward commercialization with the launch of their first commercial satellites BlueBirds 1 through 5 (Space.com). These satellites further tested vital functionalities, including seamless handoffs between satellites, a key requirement for global continuous connectivity. These launches were strategically significant, marking the transition from proof-of-concept to scalable commercial operations. Demonstration video calls were conducted and announced through MNO partners Vodafone, AT&T, and Verizon for testing AST’s technology in real-world networks. These tests were the result of the FCC granting a Special Temporary Authority (STA) to the company. This was particularly significant given its alignment with the broader regulatory landscape under the new FCC commissioner Brendan Carr (Trump Appointed) which shows the regulatory and market acceptance of AST's innovative business model. Further, this removed the Elon Musk sized elephant in the room wherein Starlink was thought to be the only satellite gaining the approval under the new administration.

**Next-Generation ASICs**

AST is also innovating on hardware performance through development of next-generation Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Replacing initial FPGA implementations, these ASIC chips promise a 100x increase in data throughput (as in total data deliverable). This dramatic efficiency improvement increases future satellite capabilities and economic performance, making their network even more attractive for commercial deployment.

**Next-Generation Satellites**

AST’s innovation continues with BlueBird 2 (BB2), a significantly scaled-up satellite design of 2,400 sq ft. Incorporating next-gen ASIC technology, these satellites represent a major leap forward in performance and capability, scheduled to be launched through agreements with Blue Origin, ISRO, and SpaceX. Through increased size and performance from the ASIC, ASTS intends to increase the 30mbps download speed represented by Block 1 to 120 mbps in future iterations of their technology. By the end of 2026, AST aims to have a constellation of approximately 60 satellites in orbit, bolstered by substantial financial backing with over $1 billion in available capital.

**Strategic Spectrum Acquisition**

See above Ligado. At character limit.

**Military and Government Partnerships**

Recognizing strategic opportunities, AST has advanced their military use cases, positioning its technology as a solution for the U.S. Department of Defense and Space Development Agency (SDA). With their satellite constellation able to integrate seamlessly with existing military satellite communication (MILSATCOM) infrastructure AST becomes highly relevant for sensitive government applications such as missile tracking, asset monitoring, and secure communications. A recent $43 million SDA contract further highlights AST’s alignment with national security interests and confirms their technology’s strategic importance.

*As part of the U.S. Space Force, SDA will accelerate delivery of needed space-based capabilities to the joint warfighter to support terrestrial missions through development, fielding, and operation of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.*

**Definition of “Value-added” for the Firm’s Products/Services**

**Resilience in Disaster Response**

One of the most compelling advantages of a space-based cellular network is its resilience during disasters. When hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, or other natural disasters strike, terrestrial infrastructure often fails. Cell towers can be knocked out by storms or burned in wildfires, leaving first responders and affected communities without communication exactly when it’s most needed. ASTS satellite technology adds a crucial layer of redundancy: even if ground towers are down, the network in the sky and a single base station anywhere in the country remains operational. This capability can be life-saving in emergency scenarios.

ASTS has been working closely with AT&T to integrate its system with FirstNet, the dedicated U.S. public safety network for first responders. FirstNet, built by AT&T, provides priority cellular service to police, firefighters, EMTs and other emergency personnel. By extending FirstNet into space, ASTS ensures that first responders stay connected in real time, anywhere. The value added by ASTS in disaster response is clear: persistent coverage when conventional networks fail.

**Cost Efficiency Compared to Subsea Cables**

Building out global internet connectivity has traditionally meant expensive infrastructure projects, such as undersea fiber-optic cables to connect continents. These projects involve enormous capital expenditures and long deployment timelines. ASTS' approach – launching a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites – presents a potentially more flexible and cost-efficient path to worldwide broadband coverage. A rough cost comparison highlights this difference in strategy and scalability. ASTS plans to deploy a complete constellation of 168 satellites to achieve global coverage. Each satellite in AST’s “BlueBird” series is estimated to cost on the order of $20 million to build and launch.

*Brian Graft, Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Anything on the cost per satellite? Has that changed at all? Are you still in that $19,000,000 to $21,000,000 range? Abel Avellan: No. Yes, we’re not changing the guidance on cost per satellite*

https://preview.redd.it/ekodb1pi40we1.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=03caa476262231e043b928ceacdee51a854d05d0

It’s important to note that satellite broadband isn’t a wholesale replacement for fiber in terms of raw capacity – major cables can carry tremendous data volume at very low latency along their fixed routes, which is vital for the core internet backbone. However, from a business strategy perspective, ASTS' satellites offer a more economical way to extend the “last mile” of connectivity to users who would otherwise require huge investment to reach.

**Enabling Always-On Connectivity for Emerging Technologies**

Beyond simply connecting people, ASTS' continuous global coverage unlocks critical opportunities for emerging technologies that depend on uninterrupted internet access. For AI agents and cloud services, constant connectivity is essential. Autonomous robotics, including self-driving cars, drones, and agricultural robots, similarly benefit from AST’s satellite service, ensuring seamless operation even in remote areas beyond traditional cellular coverage.

**Wholesale Model**

NomadBets twitter shows the breakdown of subscriber potential with ASTS. This is where revenue will blow out all expectations. 

https://preview.redd.it/6lr5z0xo40we1.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c48c2596ef8e077b391cf1ac8121122604a86d8

ASTS competencies are built around its ability to design, manufacture, and deploy large and powerful satellites optimized for direct-to-device (D2D) connectivity. All of which are critical for maximizing signal strength, bandwidth, and data throughput directly to everyday smartphones. AST's expertise in large arrays is particularly advantageous, as bigger (and thereby heavier) arrays translate directly into stronger signals, increased power generation, and significantly improved data speeds to user devices. ASTS requires just 168 large satellites for global coverage, compared to 3,236 for Amazon's Kuiper and over 8,158 for SpaceX's Starlink, this greatly reduces CAPEX, collision risk, launch risk, and replacement costs for AST. With all this in mind, AST benefits greatly from falling launch costs enabled by leading space-launch providers such as Blue Origin and SpaceX. This is best displayed as a year-over-year pricing trend of launch vehicles on a per-kilogram basis:

https://preview.redd.it/4czj2u8q40we1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1dc9937bf0e7f1da432fb69857d50618053670

As launch providers increasingly offer higher-capacity rockets at reduced costs, ASTS uniquely benefits from its strategy of deploying fewer, heavier satellites with large, high-performance antennas rather than numerous smaller satellites. The first successful flight of Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket notably demonstrated its capability to carry up to eight of AST’s Block 2 satellites simultaneously, providing a clear cost advantage. Likewise, SpaceX’s Falcon 9, recognized globally for its reliability and affordability, can accommodate four Block 2 satellites per launch. Additionally, the progress on SpaceX’s Starship program offers further promise, potentially unlocking even greater launch capacities at lower costs.

AST's operational competencies are further strengthened by its vertical integration.

*Approximately 95% vertically integrated for manufacturing of satellite components and subsystems, for which we own or license the IP and control the manufacturing process*.

By controlling its own production processes and intellectual property, AST not only reduces dependency on external suppliers—mitigating geopolitical and supply-chain risks—but also achieves superior cost efficiencies and quality control. This vertical integration is crucial at a time when the United States is prioritizing domestic capability in strategic industries like space technology, positioning AST favorably to benefit from increasing governmental support and protective policies.

The company's production strategy is robust and ambitious, with AST targeting a monthly production rate of six satellites at its Texas factory. This consistent cadence enables rapid scaling and timely replacement of satellites, ensuring continuous, reliable service for customers. Given rising geopolitical tensions, particularly concerning competition with China in space exploration and technology, AST's fully integrated, U.S.-based manufacturing operation places it strategically to capitalize on potential government partnerships or contracts aimed at strengthening domestic space capabilities.

**Organizational Structure/Culture/Leadership**

This section was about the leadership team of the company. It is just regurgitated from their own website and is not really valuable. Here is all you need to know: the CEO Abel Avellan is a certified bad ass. He has had a successful exit from his first company EMC and used that cash to fund this company. He takes no salary, he doesn’t have a crazy stock based compensation that he extracts with, he is just a good dude who is aligned with the company and its investors. He doesn’t spend his day on twitter trying to impregnate Tiffany Fong. He has not lied about his ability to play Diablo or PoE2. We like Abel. You should too.

2025-04-21,The era of American stock market exceptionalism is over,"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/american-exceptionalism-over/?ICID=continue_without_subscribing_reg_first

Nearly three quarters of fund managers think that US exceptionalism has peaked. The prevailing trend of the last decade – a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions – is over, according to the Bank of America’s latest survey.
Over the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trump’s tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated.

While it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isn’t the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets.
Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall – a scenario today’s US market is particularly vulnerable to.
One of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed.

Since 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc – over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively.

Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: “Technology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.”
However, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&P 500 has narrowed of late. A year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the US market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. That is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026.

The upset is apparent in other metrics, too. While the Magnificent Seven accounted for 50pc of the S&P 500’s earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025.

All of this adds up to a simple fact: US equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past.
In fact, Mr Stevenson warns they may underperform.
Markets are also becoming suspicious of US government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market.
Mr Gimber explains: “One of the big parts behind the US economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running.
“This has been an expansion built on US government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of US government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.”

2025-04-22,$ASTS DD The Space Trade will Cum.,"When I first wrote about ASTS [4 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0czbg/dd_asts_a_binary_bet_with_deep_space_value/), it was the first DD on the stock to appear on this subreddit. I told you to dismantle your grandparents porch to sell the top of lumber and buy the stock. I was kinda right but also terribly wrong as you can see in my [gain post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ewg3t9/conviction_or_mental_illness_you_decide_asts/). Now I am older, wiser, richer, and with a hotter wife and better DD. So settle in and learn something. Or don’t, it’s whatever. When you last ignored me there was one key point in the ASTS Investment Thesis:

1) ASTS Wholesale Model gives them access to billions of customers and thereby revenue.

* All Satellite companies (save for SpaceX’s Starlink) have failed because they cannot effectively monetize their service. Technology isn’t a problem, it’s the go-to-market strategy which fails. ASTS has solved this with its wholesale model working with existing telecoms under the FCCs rules for Supplemental Coverage from Space.

* Iridium was one of the most incredible engineering accomplishments in history, everyone who used it loved it. It was the only way calls could be made in NYC on 9/11, the only way to call out of New Orleans in Hurricane Katrina, it’s the first thing every person at the top of Everest reaches for, the list goes on.

* The problem is that Iridium couldn’t sell the service. It was expensive (for the specialized headset and by the minute in its use), people didn’t know it existed (Iridium were engineers not marketers), a market didn’t exist (maritime and remote villages and niche minute by minute sales does not a market make).

   * ASTS solves this with its super wholesale model where AT&T, Verizon, Rakuten, Vodaphone, and others do all the marketing, all the sales, all the billing, and upsell their existing customer base for a service they want anyway (more on this later).

      * ASTS does not need to find customers. Their agreements with the above give them instant access to 3B paying handsets overnight.

      * ASTS does not need to sell the world a new device. Every cell phone just works.

That is the entire story that valued ASTS to its core investors since it started trading as a SPAC. While every single ASTS long term investor lost the love of their wives as the stock cratered to 1.98, the story changed. Five additional pillars have been layered on top of the above original thesis which makes me (and you if you are capable of reading) more bullish. They are as follows:

2) Military Applications Non-Communications Use

* The large array and patented technology have more uses than just communications with cell phones.

   * They can be used as an alternative to GPS, for Missile Tracking, for PNT, and more.

   * Any piece of military equipment that can accept a small wireless chip can use ASTS.

   * The future of war is remote drone operations. They need connection. ASTS does that too.

* ASTS was awarded (through a prime contractor) a United States Space Development Agency (SDA) contract worth $43 million

   * This is for 6 satellites for one year and paid out linearly.

   * Fairwinds advertisement for the service shows ASTS communicating with existing Military Satellites.

   * This award will likely be expanded as more satellites come into service.

* Hybrid Acquisition for proliferated Low-earth Orbit (HALO) program

   * ASTS was awarded a starter contract as their own prime.

   * The program can cover launch and parts costs on top of service payments.

   * End game of this is ASTS use for missile tracking in the “Golden Dome” the Trump administration wants to build out.

3) European Monopoly / Satco Joint Venture with Vodaphone

* ASTS and Vodaphone created a joint venture for all of Europe where they will sell the service to other European Telcos. They will also be offering the service to the European Government much like the company is currently doing in the US.

   * Importantly all the data will be sent and received entirely in the EU. All infrastructure will live in the EU. It will be an entirely European Company to be more marketable in Europe.

* All of this has happened as Elon is nuking his rep in Europe with “roman” salutes and threating to withhold Ukraine’s access to Starlink. People are realizing that Elon is not dependable, and they need alternatives. ASTS is that alternative.

4) The company has begun to acquire Ligado Spectrum to create their own data service which does not rely on the leasing of spectrum from AT&T and Verizon.

* This Ligado spectrum has been unusable in the past due to interference with GPS and military spectrum in nearby bands.

   * Ligado was using this Satellite Spectrum as Terrestrial with FCC waivers unsuccessfully.

   * ASTS brings value to this spectrum through its beam forming which results in no interference.

* Spectrum can be valued on a per mhz per population basis.

   * At .40 - .80 /MHz-pop \* 40 MHZ \* 330M people in the United States we can value this spectrum at \~8Billion dollars.

      * This is the entire Market Cap of ASTS as it stands today.

      * The company is acquiring the exclusive use of this spectrum for far below this cost. (350M + 4.7M penny warrants + 80M / year + small revenue share)

      * The value of spectrum based on previous auctions likely discounts the future value of spectrum based on the number of connected devices we will be seeing in the future. There is more upside than the $8B figure represents (see point 5Bi).

   * ASTS does its own design and manufacturing and is already designing a new satellite to work with its Ligado spectrum.

   * This deal closing will allow ASTS to sell capacity to its partners or offer their own service ala Starlink.

5) AI requires constant connectivity

* [Facebook is spending $10B to put fiber underwater for bigger pipes for their own data](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/29/meta-plans-to-build-a-10b-subsea-cable-spanning-the-world-sources-say/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB9Zn-QxaAgZypcTXZnX7qnT_XW8Gtm4Lo4e7AnQZD3d-HkWV24RLmg0B_RTon33a68Fc4NrzIVFSP-WXsOWjJOjFeE1wLz0KSRP2ZuVXG6ExThE5kmYcSVrb7JhUouBqIV1sWg4g1T-G7jWRobaSH1MIwaH3ANKhUl_xh4xsg7X). That’s all that you need to know about where the biggest companies believe data is going with the introduction of AI. ASTS solves this and blankets the entire earth with data connectivity (albeit with less speed).

   * However, building this giant globe spanning fiber still does not solve the issue of connectivity in the outer reaches of the planet. This is just for the easily accessible areas meaning ASTS still provides value in data delivery which may be of use to companies like Facebook.

* Autonomous AI Agents need connection and backup connections to operate. Data delivery in all corners of the world matters to make use of AI.

* Think of every time you have paid $20 for internet on a plane. You need it access to data too, even if you think AI doesn’t (it does).

   * Consider the number of connected “things” you have now. Airtags, smart watches, phones, laptops, cars, trucks, fucking killer drones from Palmer Lucky, farm equipment, doorbells, your wife’s WiFi Dildo that actually makes her cum unlike you, your WiFi buttplug, etc. All of this adds value to the ability to reliably deliver internet to all corners of the planet. That is ASTS’ market.

6) Space is strategic

* When I first wrote about the company I thought Elon and Bezos were just playing with the new billionaires toy of rockets. It turns out they were just one step ahead of the game. Space is strategic and having access to your own internet is incredibly valuable given the need for constant connection with AI. They know this and are leveraging their launch capacity to build out their own private internet.

* ASTS benefits from an increase in launch capacity by having these billionaires fight for ASTS billions of dollars in launch costs. ASTS can essentially play king maker. Every dollar which goes to Blue Origin isn’t going to SpaceX and vice versa. ASTS future launch cadence with its \~150 launches represents billions in launch costs. They can make the below fight for the lowest cost to get this future business. Note: ASTS already has agreements for 60 launches into the end of 2026. At 20 satellites the company expects to be at cash flow breakeven.

* Don't bet against the below. The Space Trade will come.

   * Elon Musk – Starlink SpaceX

   * Jeff Bezos – Blue Origin New Glenn Kupier

   * Eric Schmidt – Relativity

   * Peter Beck – Rocket Lab

   * Abel Avellan - ASTS

  
Before one of you morons say “waaaaaa but what about starlink?” shut the fuck up and get out of my DD. Thanks. Starlink proper does not speak to cell phones which is why they require end users to have a dish or a mini dish to use their service. Their direct to cell solution with T-Mobile is not purpose built and has failed to deliver simple text messages. Take some time to read reviews of their service. It is complete shit and has no hopes of delivering broadband speed like ASTS without a complete redesign (which is probably difficult given that their lead engineer for D2C just left the company. Not a great look innit?). Alright with that out of the way we can continue. The rest of this writeup I completed for school and is a technical writeup of the company. Enjoy or whatever. There is very little information about the business valuation because I am not smart like that (or in any other way but neither are you). **If you want to know more**, read u/thekookreport ‘s DD [document](https://www.kookreport.com/post/ast-spacemobile-asts-the-mobile-satellite-cellular-network-monopoly-please-find-my-final-comp). ***It is incredible and if you take the time to read it you might have the conviction required to acquire generational wealth. Good luck!*** Anyways here ya go bud:

**Company and Industry Background**

AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) is pioneering direct-to-device satellite connectivity, enabling standard, unmodified smartphones to connect directly to satellites for broadband cellular service. This groundbreaking technology positions ASTS uniquely to deliver global mobile broadband coverage, especially in areas lacking traditional terrestrial infrastructure. Through large, powerful phased-array antennas deployed on satellites in low Earth orbit, ASTS creates ""cell towers in space"" which provide seamless connectivity without the need for specialized satellite phones or additional equipment like satellite dishes.

Globally, approximately 2.6 billion people lack internet access (World Economic Forum), primarily due to economic barriers in deploying terrestrial networks in remote or sparsely populated regions. ASTS addresses this significant digital divide by allowing these individuals to access broadband services using any existing smartphone.

*According to Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (“GSMA”), as of December 31, 2024, approximately 5.8 billion mobile subscribers are constantly moving in and out of coverage, approximately 3.4 billion people have no cellular broadband coverage and approximately 350.0 million people have no connectivity or mobile cellular coverage*.

There are approximately 6.8 Billion smartphones in the world all of which would be compatible with ASTS service on Day 1 without any modifications required as their service purely mimics existing GSMA service. As global connectivity becomes increasingly essential, particularly with the rapid expansion and integration of artificial intelligence, the value of ASTS grows exponentially.

ASTS strategically targets underserved regions in both developed and developing markets, focusing on areas where conventional terrestrial infrastructure is economically impractical or geographically challenging. The company's approach aligns with the FCC's Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) framework (FCC-23-22A1), which outlines the means of providing cell phone coverage from space and necessitates spectrum leasing agreements with established Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). Recognizing this requirement, ASTS has secured strategic investments from industry leaders such as Google, AT&T, Verizon, American Tower, and Vodafone. These investments validate ASTS's technological and business approach, simultaneously offering traditional MNOs a beneficial partnership. Operators like AT&T and Verizon benefit by monetizing their spectrum in otherwise unused regions. This also benefits MNOs and American Tower by effectively hedging their terrestrial tower businesses against the propagation of space-based service and maximizing existing assets and valuable spectrum.

Unlike conventional satellite phone providers or systems such as Starlink and Project Kuiper, which compensate for smaller satellite footprints by relying heavily on extensive ground infrastructure, ASTS's design is distinct. It employs significantly larger satellite antenna arrays, enabling direct communication with regular mobile phones without modifications. The large antennas generate a robust, ""loud"" signal from space, capable of directly reaching unmodified consumer devices—contrasting sharply with traditional satellite phones, which rely on devices actively searching for faint satellite signals. Additionally, ASTS's larger arrays dramatically reduce the total number of satellites needed for global coverage. For instance, while Project Kuiper plans to deploy 3,236 satellites and Starlink already operates over 8,000 satellites, ASTS aims to achieve global coverage with approximately 168 satellites. This not only optimizes efficiency but also addresses growing concerns about orbital congestion and space debris.

The wholesale go-to-market strategy adopted by ASTS leverages existing customer bases from mobile network operators, providing a significant competitive advantage. Unlike previous satellite endeavors, such as Iridium—which faced challenges not with technology but with market adoption due to high costs and complex marketing—ASTS offers a straightforward, accessible solution that integrates seamlessly with existing mobile ecosystems. The model ensures rapid adoption and scalability, delivering reliable broadband service globally without the barriers encountered by traditional satellite communication providers.

To further enhance customer accessibility and peace of mind, ASTS offers flexible pricing options such as day passes and affordable monthly fees, ensuring users remain consistently connected wherever they travel. This model caters to the growing expectation of constant connectivity, as increasingly more devices—including cars, smartwatches, location trackers, and other IoT gadgets—rely on continuous internet access. Consumers regularly demonstrate willingness to pay for reliable connectivity, just think of every time you have paid or considered paying $24.99 for in-flight Wi-Fi.

*In fact, early findings show nearly two-thirds of subscribers are willing to pay extra \[for satellite connectivity\], with about half open to \~$5/month for off-grid connectivity*

**Source(s) of innovation**

When a cell phone initiates a call or sends data, the signal travels through an uplink from the device to the nearest cell tower. At the tower’s base station, this signal is processed and forwarded through a high-capacity connection known as backhaul, typically via fiber-optic cables or microwave links, toward the network core. The network core functions like the network's brain, determining the signal’s destination and routing it accordingly. From the network core, the call or data is directed out through the appropriate aggregation points and backhaul connections toward the recipient’s nearest tower. At this final cell tower, the signal is sent via a downlink directly to the receiving user’s phone, completing the communication.

In contrast, ASTS' approach replaces traditional cell towers and terrestrial backhaul infrastructure with satellites positioned in low Earth orbit. When a phone communicates with AST's BlueBird satellite, the uplink signal travels directly from the user's phone to the satellite itself, acting as a ""tower in space."" The satellite processes and beams the signal back down to strategically located ground gateways that connect to the terrestrial network core, bypassing the extensive network of ground towers and traditional backhaul. The core network then routes the call or data to the recipient, either via terrestrial towers or via another satellite beam. This approach effectively removes geographic barriers, delivering cellular connectivity even in remote or underserved areas where traditional terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable or economically impractical.

Starlink has recently gained significant attention with its high-profile Super Bowl advertisement showcasing their satellite texting offering with T-Mobile, bringing public awareness to direct-to-device (D2D) connectivity (Mobile World Live). However, despite this increased visibility, Starlink faces inherent technological limitations in its beam-forming capabilities. The satellite's antennas generate broad, flashlight-like beams that cover large geographical areas but lack precision. This approach leads to increased interference with neighboring networks and limits Starlink's ability to efficiently reuse spectrum, ultimately restricting network capacity and data throughput for individual users.

Starlink's beam design contrasts sharply with more advanced D2D satellite systems that utilize precise, narrowly-focused beams to minimize interference and maximize spectrum efficiency. Due to Starlink's broader beam coverage, each satellite can serve fewer distinct user groups simultaneously, which reduces overall service quality and speed per user. As a result, while Starlink's high-profile marketing has drawn consumer attention to satellite-based mobile connectivity, its practical applications remain constrained, particularly in densely populated or interference-sensitive areas where efficient beam management and high throughput are critical.

Comparatively, ASTS employs significantly narrower, laser-focused beams enabled by their large phased-array antennas, as detailed in FCC filings (FCC 20200413-00034). ASTS satellites can generate beams as narrow as less than one degree, precisely targeting coverage areas and significantly reducing interference. In contrast, Starlink’s FCC filings (FCC 1091870146061) indicate beam widths that can span tens or hundreds of kilometers, with antenna gains around 38 dBi, resulting in broader coverage but increased interference and reduced spectral efficiency. ASTS's advanced beam-forming capabilities allow for precise, efficient frequency reuse and higher overall throughput per user, providing a notable advantage over Starlink in both performance and spectrum management.

https://preview.redd.it/xgl7egn940we1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b23b49ff581a6570c470fb5666a6006417d6fd50

The top image taken from FCC Filings represents the antenna pattern for ASTS' system, akin to a laser pointer, with a very sharp, narrow central beam and significantly lower sidelobes. This tight focus ensures the energy is highly concentrated, minimizing interference with other areas and maximizing the signal strength in the intended coverage zone. Conversely, the bottom image illustrates Starlink's broader beam pattern, similar to a flashlight, with a wide central lobe and substantial sidelobes. The broader distribution of energy leads to greater interference and less precise coverage, reducing overall network efficiency and limiting the achievable throughput per user.

ASTS innovation is best shown in their extensive patent portfolio some of which protect this signal creation. 

https://preview.redd.it/fzqf4ijb40we1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=2112a61c00314bf51eb1de3a0837501f7067bc96

ASTS utilizes significantly larger satellites featuring advanced phased-array antennas that unfold in orbit, allowing them to generate stronger and more precise signals directly to standard mobile phones. The satellite itself employs a straightforward ""bent pipe"" design, which simply receives signals from phones and redirects them toward ground gateways without complex onboard processing. The sophisticated management of signals is handled by ASTS's proprietary software on the ground, ensuring seamless integration with existing mobile carrier networks and compatibility with current and future mobile technologies (including 6G). We can examine some key patents  from the company to gain a better understanding of their technology advantage:

**Mechanical Deployable Structure for LEO:** This patent covers AST’s deployment mechanism for its large flat satellites​. The satellite’s antenna array is made of many square/rectangular panels (with solar on one side and antennas on the other) hinged together with spring-loaded connectors. These stored-energy hinges (often called spring tapes) automatically unfold the panels into a contiguous flat array once the satellite is in space, without needing motors or power to do the deployment. In essence, the satellite launches compactly folded up, and when it reaches orbit, it pops open on its own like a spring-loaded blanket. This is a core enabler for ASTS business: it allows them to fit a very large antenna into a small launch volume and reliably deploy it in orbit​. The self-deploying design reduces complexity and points of failure (since fewer motors or controls are needed), lowering launch and manufacturing costs. Successfully deploying a massive antenna is critical for AST’s service capability.

https://preview.redd.it/7iewd2jc40we1.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=6561e0f1bf475df91dddb0b405ce48f860b72ad4

**Integrated Antenna Module with Thermal Management:** This patent describes the flat antenna module that integrates solar cells and radio antennas into one structure and includes built-in cooling features​. In simple terms, each panel on ASTS satellite serves as both a power source (via solar cells) and a communication antenna, while also dissipating its own heat. This means the satellite can be made up of many such panels tiled into the huge antenna array above without overheating. This innovation allows ASTS to deploy very large, power-efficient antennas in orbit, enabling stronger signals and broad coverage for mobile users without the weight or complexity of separate cooling systems.

https://preview.redd.it/igtsmgfd40we1.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=46f9469918898ad963dcaab50aa229f2ce8ffdc1

**Dynamic Time Division Duplex (DTDD) for Satellite Networks:** This patent introduces a smart timing controller that manages uplink and downlink signals so they don’t collide when using time-division duplex (TDD) over satellite​. In layman’s terms, because satellites are far away, signals take longer to travel – this system dynamically adjusts when a phone should send vs. receive so that echoes of a transmission don’t interfere with new data. For ASTS, this technology is crucial: it lets standard mobile phones communicate seamlessly with satellites by fine-tuning timing, which improves network reliability and throughput. Without this patent the time between uplink and downlink would result in loss of signal as normal cell signals are not used to the latency experienced in space travel.

**Geolocation of Devices Using Spaceborne Phased Arrays:** This patent outlines a method for pinpointing a phone’s location from space using the satellite’s phased-array antenna​. The satellite first uses its multiple beams to get a rough location (which cell or area the device is in), then refines the device’s position by analyzing Doppler shifts and signal travel time. The satellite can not only talk to your phone but also figure out where you are by how your signal frequency changes (due to motion) and delays, similar to how GPS works but using the communication signal itself.

**Direct GSM Communication via Satellite:** This patent covers a solution that allows standard GSM mobile phones (2G phones) to connect directly to a satellite​. The system involves a satellite with a coverage area divided into cells and a ground infrastructure that includes a feeder link and tracking antenna to manage the connection. A primary processing device communicates with the active users’ phones, and a secondary processor adjusts timing delays for all the beams/cells. This tricks the GSM phones into thinking the satellite is just another cell tower by handling the long signal delay.

https://preview.redd.it/f8er6l9e40we1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=abca83f58c82d29a8223d56ad0a26db503aecf2e

**Network Access Management for Satellite RAN:** This patent describes a method to efficiently handle when a user device first tries to connect to a satellite-based radio network​. The idea is to use a single wide beam from the satellite to watch for any phone requesting access across a large area of many cells. Once a phone’s request is detected in a particular cell, the system then lights up that cell with a focused beam (and can broadcast necessary signals to other inactive cells as needed). Essentially, the satellite first yells “anyone out there?” over a broad area, and when a phone waves back, the satellite switches to a more targeted conversation with that phone’s sector. This on-demand beam switching is business-critical for ASTS: it conserves power and spectrum by not constantly servicing empty regions, allowing one satellite to cover many cells efficiently. It means the network can support more users over a wide area with fewer satellites, lowering operational costs and improving user experience by quickly granting access when someone pops up in a normally quiet zone.

**Satellite MIMO Communication System:** This patent describes a technique for using multiple antennas on both the satellite (or satellites) and the user side to create a MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) link for data​. In simple terms, the base station on the ground can send out multiple distinct radio streams through different satellite beams or even different satellites to a device that has several antennas. By doing so, the end user (if capable, like modern phones with multiple antennas) can receive parallel data streams, boosting throughput.

**Seamless Beam Handover Between Satellites:** This patent deals with handing off a user’s connection from one low-Earth-orbit satellite to the next to avoid dropped calls or data sessions​. It outlines a system where an area on Earth (cell) that is covered by a setting satellite (one moving out of view) is also in view of a rising satellite. The network uses overlapping beams: one satellite’s beam and then the other’s beam cover the same cell during handover. A processing device orchestrates two communication links and switches the user’s session from the first satellite to the second as the first goes over the horizon.

**Types/Patterns of Innovation**

**Initial Testing**

AST began its journey in 2019 with modest yet creative experiment. Their first satellite, BlueWalker 1 (BW1), placed the components of an everyday cell phone into space as a nanosatellite developed in collaboration with NanoAvionics. Instead of the conventional and costly approach—launching a satellite to communicate with ground-based phones, AST reversed this arrangement. They connected a cell phone in orbit with a specialized ground-based satellite (BlueWalker 2). This unusual yet insightful solution significantly reduced the initial costs of launch deployment, enabling rapid and cost-effective R&D. This approach was innovative both economically and operationally, demonstrating practical, real-world viability of their core concept.

https://preview.redd.it/hkwipmdf40we1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5c9f53577d14b69f873d75c4a3e98bfd039c361

**Funding and Expansion**

Early on, the company attracted strategic backing from the telecom industry. In 2020, a Series B round of $110 million was led by Vodafone and Japan’s Rakuten, with participation from Samsung, and American Tower signaling broad industry confidence in AST’s direct-to-phone satellite technology. Importantly, during this time these investors did their own due diligence on the business and verified the work up to this point and the business case. Rather than a traditional IPO, ASTS utilized a SPAC merger to go public: in April 2021 it merged with New Providence Acquisition Corp., raising a total of $462 million in gross proceeds including $230 million from a PIPE investment by Vodafone, Rakuten, and American Tower.

**BlueWalker 3 Satellite**

With SPAC funding secured, ASTS increased their R&D spend to launch a fully functional satellite, BlueWalker 3 (BW3), featuring the largest phased-array antenna ever deployed in space (save for the international space station). The satellite was approximately 700 sq ft, roughly the size of a one-bedroom apartment. BW3 employed Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), enabling in-orbit software upgrades and flexible testing to allow changes not captured with BW1 to be complete after launch. Successful demonstrations of BW3's capability included groundbreaking tests such as the first-ever 5G video call from space to an everyday smartphone in Hawaii, validating their ability to deliver advanced broadband connectivity directly from orbit.

**BlueBird Block 1**

In September 2024, AST took critical steps toward commercialization with the launch of their first commercial satellites BlueBirds 1 through 5 (Space.com). These satellites further tested vital functionalities, including seamless handoffs between satellites, a key requirement for global continuous connectivity. These launches were strategically significant, marking the transition from proof-of-concept to scalable commercial operations. Demonstration video calls were conducted and announced through MNO partners Vodafone, AT&T, and Verizon for testing AST’s technology in real-world networks. These tests were the result of the FCC granting a Special Temporary Authority (STA) to the company. This was particularly significant given its alignment with the broader regulatory landscape under the new FCC commissioner Brendan Carr (Trump Appointed) which shows the regulatory and market acceptance of AST's innovative business model. Further, this removed the Elon Musk sized elephant in the room wherein Starlink was thought to be the only satellite gaining the approval under the new administration.

https://preview.redd.it/eug6ardg40we1.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ae60b0b69faf8b96915df1273f762cef6232861

**Next-Generation ASICs**

AST is also innovating on hardware performance through development of next-generation Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Replacing initial FPGA implementations, these ASIC chips promise a 100x increase in data throughput (as in total data deliverable). This dramatic efficiency improvement increases future satellite capabilities and economic performance, making their network even more attractive for commercial deployment.

**Next-Generation Satellites**

AST’s innovation continues with BlueBird 2 (BB2), a significantly scaled-up satellite design of 2,400 sq ft. Incorporating next-gen ASIC technology, these satellites represent a major leap forward in performance and capability, scheduled to be launched through agreements with Blue Origin, ISRO, and SpaceX. Through increased size and performance from the ASIC, ASTS intends to increase the 30mbps download speed represented by Block 1 to 120 mbps in future iterations of their technology. By the end of 2026, AST aims to have a constellation of approximately 60 satellites in orbit, bolstered by substantial financial backing with over $1 billion in available capital.

**Strategic Spectrum Acquisition**

See above Ligado. At character limit.

**Military and Government Partnerships**

Recognizing strategic opportunities, AST has advanced their military use cases, positioning its technology as a solution for the U.S. Department of Defense and Space Development Agency (SDA). With their satellite constellation able to integrate seamlessly with existing military satellite communication (MILSATCOM) infrastructure AST becomes highly relevant for sensitive government applications such as missile tracking, asset monitoring, and secure communications. A recent $43 million SDA contract further highlights AST’s alignment with national security interests and confirms their technology’s strategic importance.

*As part of the U.S. Space Force, SDA will accelerate delivery of needed space-based capabilities to the joint warfighter to support terrestrial missions through development, fielding, and operation of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.*

**Definition of “Value-added” for the Firm’s Products/Services**

**Resilience in Disaster Response**

One of the most compelling advantages of a space-based cellular network is its resilience during disasters. When hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, or other natural disasters strike, terrestrial infrastructure often fails. Cell towers can be knocked out by storms or burned in wildfires, leaving first responders and affected communities without communication exactly when it’s most needed. ASTS satellite technology adds a crucial layer of redundancy: even if ground towers are down, the network in the sky and a single base station anywhere in the country remains operational. This capability can be life-saving in emergency scenarios.

ASTS has been working closely with AT&T to integrate its system with FirstNet, the dedicated U.S. public safety network for first responders. FirstNet, built by AT&T, provides priority cellular service to police, firefighters, EMTs and other emergency personnel. By extending FirstNet into space, ASTS ensures that first responders stay connected in real time, anywhere. The value added by ASTS in disaster response is clear: persistent coverage when conventional networks fail.

**Cost Efficiency Compared to Subsea Cables**

Building out global internet connectivity has traditionally meant expensive infrastructure projects, such as undersea fiber-optic cables to connect continents. These projects involve enormous capital expenditures and long deployment timelines. ASTS' approach – launching a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites – presents a potentially more flexible and cost-efficient path to worldwide broadband coverage. A rough cost comparison highlights this difference in strategy and scalability. ASTS plans to deploy a complete constellation of 168 satellites to achieve global coverage. Each satellite in AST’s “BlueBird” series is estimated to cost on the order of $20 million to build and launch.

*Brian Graft, Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Anything on the cost per satellite? Has that changed at all? Are you still in that $19,000,000 to $21,000,000 range? Abel Avellan: No. Yes, we’re not changing the guidance on cost per satellite*

https://preview.redd.it/ekodb1pi40we1.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=03caa476262231e043b928ceacdee51a854d05d0

It’s important to note that satellite broadband isn’t a wholesale replacement for fiber in terms of raw capacity – major cables can carry tremendous data volume at very low latency along their fixed routes, which is vital for the core internet backbone. However, from a business strategy perspective, ASTS' satellites offer a more economical way to extend the “last mile” of connectivity to users who would otherwise require huge investment to reach.

**Enabling Always-On Connectivity for Emerging Technologies**

Beyond simply connecting people, ASTS' continuous global coverage unlocks critical opportunities for emerging technologies that depend on uninterrupted internet access. For AI agents and cloud services, constant connectivity is essential. Autonomous robotics, including self-driving cars, drones, and agricultural robots, similarly benefit from AST’s satellite service, ensuring seamless operation even in remote areas beyond traditional cellular coverage.

**Wholesale Model**

https://preview.redd.it/6lr5z0xo40we1.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c48c2596ef8e077b391cf1ac8121122604a86d8

ASTS competencies are built around its ability to design, manufacture, and deploy large and powerful satellites optimized for direct-to-device (D2D) connectivity. All of which are critical for maximizing signal strength, bandwidth, and data throughput directly to everyday smartphones. AST's expertise in large arrays is particularly advantageous, as bigger (and thereby heavier) arrays translate directly into stronger signals, increased power generation, and significantly improved data speeds to user devices. ASTS requires just 168 large satellites for global coverage, compared to 3,236 for Amazon's Kuiper and over 8,158 for SpaceX's Starlink, this greatly reduces CAPEX, collision risk, launch risk, and replacement costs for AST. With all this in mind, AST benefits greatly from falling launch costs enabled by leading space-launch providers such as Blue Origin and SpaceX. This is best displayed as a year-over-year pricing trend of launch vehicles on a per-kilogram basis:

https://preview.redd.it/4czj2u8q40we1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1dc9937bf0e7f1da432fb69857d50618053670

As launch providers increasingly offer higher-capacity rockets at reduced costs, ASTS uniquely benefits from its strategy of deploying fewer, heavier satellites with large, high-performance antennas rather than numerous smaller satellites. The first successful flight of Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket notably demonstrated its capability to carry up to eight of AST’s Block 2 satellites simultaneously, providing a clear cost advantage. Likewise, SpaceX’s Falcon 9, recognized globally for its reliability and affordability, can accommodate four Block 2 satellites per launch. Additionally, the progress on SpaceX’s Starship program offers further promise, potentially unlocking even greater launch capacities at lower costs.

AST's operational competencies are further strengthened by its vertical integration.

*Approximately 95% vertically integrated for manufacturing of satellite components and subsystems, for which we own or license the IP and control the manufacturing process*.

By controlling its own production processes and intellectual property, AST not only reduces dependency on external suppliers—mitigating geopolitical and supply-chain risks—but also achieves superior cost efficiencies and quality control. This vertical integration is crucial at a time when the United States is prioritizing domestic capability in strategic industries like space technology, positioning AST favorably to benefit from increasing governmental support and protective policies.

The company's production strategy is robust and ambitious, with AST targeting a monthly production rate of six satellites at its Texas factory. This consistent cadence enables rapid scaling and timely replacement of satellites, ensuring continuous, reliable service for customers. Given rising geopolitical tensions, particularly concerning competition with China in space exploration and technology, AST's fully integrated, U.S.-based manufacturing operation places it strategically to capitalize on potential government partnerships or contracts aimed at strengthening domestic space capabilities.

**Organizational Structure/Culture/Leadership**

This section was about the leadership team of the company. It is just regurgitated from their own website and is not really valuable. Here is all you need to know: the CEO Abel Avellan is a certified bad ass. He has had a successful exit from his first company EMC and used that cash to fund this company. He takes no salary, he doesn’t have a crazy stock based compensation that he extracts with, he is just a good dude who is aligned with the company and its investors. He doesn’t spend his day on twitter trying to impregnate Tiffany Fong. He has not lied about his ability to play Diablo or PoE2. We like Abel. You should too.

I never would have guessed people wouldn't believe me.    I have also attached an image screenshot of the email they sent me.  I don't think I get to chose where the image appears, so I apologize if things are not laid out nicely.

https://preview.redd.it/5hkcwjz46wwe1.jpg?width=902&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b451e10ff8c580cfc269f928adce9f255320844

\-----------  
I came here to ask if it was safe to use my Quest 3 headset because it had been a good six months since I had turned it on. Everyone on the forum assured me that Meta had solved the bricking problem, and that if it happened, they would take care of it and get me fixed (after a big public backlash)

So I turned it on and used it for a bit. So, the day it died, I was playing Arizona Sunshine 2 with  
my buddy and at the end I had to go to the bathroom really bad. When I got  
back, I went to turn my headset off, and it said that it was doing an update  
and would shut down when it was done. (something along those lines) So I left  
it plugged in ""just in case"" because of all my years in IT I knew you  
would never want to interrupt an update. And then I went and had dinner with my  
son.

When I returned later, the headset was off. And it has never turned back on again. Just dead to the  
world. I've tried long pressing the power button, tapping the power button,  
using the power button + volume down hold, and nothing. Never a flicker of light.  
Just nothing.

When I plug it in, I don't even see the charging light (or green light). Nothing.

So, I open a support ticket, feeling sick to my stomach and support and they did not have any advice  
for me that I had not already tried.

The headset was bought for me by my two sons for my birthday in Jan. And it was March, and since they  
only offer a 1-year warranty I was 6 weeks or so out of warranty. So they want  
me to send them my old headset, and pay $340 for a Quest 3 128 refurbished unit  
that comes with 90 days of warranty.

I don't see how that is fair.

I didn't tell them, and loathe to admit it, but being disabled, VR is the only way I can get out and  
see the world, and interact with friends from a rolling chair without leaving  
my house. My HTC Vive headset is still working fine after 8 years of use, but I  
just got rid of it and was all in on the Quest 3. Now I feel horrible about  
that decision. Ugh.

When you consider that  
half the year, I didn't use this, it really must not have many hours on it, at  
all. It still looks brand new. You can't even opt out of the updates, so this  
could happen again at any time.

I mean, I can buy a brand-new  
Quest 3s 128 for $269

But if I am going to have  
to buy a new one every year, I just can't afford that.

2025-04-25,Meta is laying off employees in Reality Labs,"Meta has laid off an unspecified number of employees in its Reality Labs division, a company spokesperson confirmed.

The cuts affected teams working in Oculus Studios, Meta’s in-house games division for Quest headsets, as well as some employees involved in the company’s hardware efforts, according to people familiar with the matter. Specific titles impacted by the layoffs include Supernatural, the VR fitness game that Meta acquired for over $400 million and successfully defended from a government antitrust lawsuit attempting to block the sale. A note on the official Supernatural Facebook group states that “these changes are meant to help us work more efficiently on what the future of fitness could be.”

“Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size,” Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said in a statement. “These changes are meant to help Studios work more efficiently on future mixed reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today. We remain committed to investing in mixed reality experiences, including fitness and games, and our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged.” He declined to comment on the cuts outside of Oculus Studios.

While sales of Meta’s smart glasses with Ray-Ban have grown faster than the company expected, Quest sales have continued to struggle. The latest Quest 3S, which Meta released last fall, is currently on sale for roughly 10 percent off in some configurations.

2025-04-29,What should I be looking at in the upcoming META earning call?,"For Meta Platforms (META), the upcoming earnings call (scheduled for April 30, after market close) is highly anticipated, especially with big tech volatility and renewed focus on AI, advertising, and cost control. Here are the most important things to watch and key questions the market will focus on:

# 1. Advertising Revenue & AI Initiatives

* **Core Focus:** Analysts expect AI-driven improvements in ad targeting and engagement to drive modest revenue and EPS beats, with estimates at $41.36 billion in revenue and $5.21 EPS.
* **Watch for:**
   * Specific numbers and commentary on AI’s impact on ad efficiency and pricing.
   * Competitive positioning versus other social platforms and Google.
   * How AI tools are translating into measurable monetization gains.

# 2. Cost Controls & Margins

* **Key Metrics:** Operating margin, net margin, and cash flow are in focus as META’s cost discipline has been a major driver of stock gains recently.
* **Watch for:**
   * Updated cost guidance, especially R&D and infrastructure spend for AI.
   * Is cost discipline sustainable, or is spending ramping up again (especially for Reality Labs and AI infrastructure)?

# 3. Reality Labs / Metaverse Segment

* **Trends Analysis:** There’s been a major spike in public interest in Reality Labs in the last few months, likely tied to new product launches or AI innovations.
* **Watch for:**
   * Progress on AR/VR devices, user engagement metrics, and revenue/cost breakdowns.
   * Management’s view on the timeline for profitability in Reality Labs.

# 4. Regulatory Risks & Shareholder Proposals

* **News Focus:** Ongoing regulatory scrutiny (antitrust, privacy, content) and a notable shareholder proposal addressing online antisemitism and hate speech risks.
* **Watch for:**
   * Management’s commentary on legal and regulatory headwinds.
   * Updates on how META is addressing shareholder concerns regarding platform safety and governance.

# 5. AI Spending & Geopolitical Headwinds

* **News Focus:** Investor concerns about Meta’s AI capex amid tariff and trade policy uncertainty (especially with recent political headlines).
* **Watch for:**
   * Any adjustments to AI/data center spending plans.
   * Management’s assessment of tariff/trade impacts on supply chain and costs.

# 6. Valuation & Guidance

* **Current Valuation:** META’s trailing P/E is \~22.3, with strong growth (EPS up 62% YoY, revenue up 22% YoY) but recent stock price pullback (down \~28% from peak).
* **Watch for:**
   * Updated guidance for Q2 and full-year—are growth and margin targets intact?
   * Commentary on buybacks or potential capital returns (dividends, repurchases).

# What Analysts & the Market Want to Hear

* Evidence that AI is not just a buzzword but is materially driving revenue and efficiency.
* Confidence that META can navigate regulatory and cost challenges without derailing growth.
* A roadmap for profitability or meaningful traction from Reality Labs.
* Clarity on spending discipline and capital allocation priorities.

# Trends & Sentiment

* Public and market interest in Reality Labs is surging, while the core Family of Apps sees steady but less dramatic attention—pointing to high expectations for innovation and new product cycles.
* Sentiment remains cautiously optimistic but sensitive to any negative surprises, especially on costs or regulatory issues.

**Action Item:** Listen for specifics on AI monetization, cost outlook, regulatory strategy, and Reality Labs progress. Management’s tone and detail on these fronts will likely drive META’s post-earnings price action.",0,17

* **Revenue**: $42.31 billion vs. $41.40 billion expected

The company said that second quarter sales will be in range of $42.5 to $45.5 billion.

2025-05-11,"Is investing in stocks already heavily favored by ETFs smart? Furthermore, is 100% stock portfolios worth the risk?","I left a comment elsewhere which after posting it made me curious about making it a post. Forgive me if I spell something incorrectly, English is not my first language.

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4590406

So I read this paper about 100% Stock portfolios after watching a YouTube video on it (multiple out there).

And I wondered how I’d go about choosing the stocks I’d invest in. I did so because just last year I didn’t touch stocks but when I went on my app on my iPhone (Stocks) and saw how much I could have made had I just invested in stocks that were already a big presence in almost all of my ETFs the. I’d have more value to my name.

To look at it I viewed an era that had large fluctuations in which I invested in which lead me to 2019 to 2024 because in-between that we had the fed-induced boom and the crash that came before that along with other crazy fluctuations.

So for my example I used march 2019 to March 2024 (which had steep decreases and increases):

1.MSFT: 250.92% 
2.Apple: 248%
3.Meta: 176.44%
4.Googl: 149%
5.Amazon: 96.46%

1.QQQ: 140.45%
2.VTI: 84.34%
3.VOO: 81.39%
4.VT: 54.38%

Here is the Summary of percentages those sticks hold for each ETF:

1. QQQ: ~41.3%
2. VOO: ~22.2%
3. VTI: ~13.0%
4. VT: ~6.1%


It’s not like investing in Meta, Apple, Google, and Amazon is unheard of, they already make a huge part of all ETFs you come across that measure commonly used domestic indexes. So… is this the way? I truly want your critique on this because if it works it works and if not then it doesn’t, it’s not about proving I’m right it’s about maximizing my understanding of investing. 



Edit: I think people misunderstood and I didn’t articulate it well either. IM NOT PREACHING FOR 100% stocks but I want your opinions on it! I want to see if maybe it IS the way. I want to grow my knowledge on the topic.

2025-05-13,"Mega-caps will dominate the market long term (destroy my argument with logic, please)","**Thesis:** The largest mega-cap stocks will consolidate market dominance in the coming decades due to their privileged access to transformative technologies, structural advantages, and capital. Accordingly, portfolios with a bias toward mega-caps will tend to outperform others in the medium-to-long term.

**Argument:**

1. **The Trend Has Already Started.** Over the past ~5 years, U.S. mega-cap stocks have dramatically outperformed the broader market. For instance, the Magnificent Seven have collectively driven the majority of gains in the U.S. equities market (MAGS returned ~103% over past 5 years while QQQ returned ~60% and SPY returned ~41%—and the returns of Nasdaq and S&P would be significantly lower if MAGS’s returns were excluded). *Naturally, past performance is not a meaningful indicator of future performance under normal circumstances.* But I argue we are *not* in normal circumstances, and this trend is not a short-term anomaly. Rather, reflects deeper structural forces that are to likely persist, and even intensify.

2. **Entrenched Scale Advantages in the AI Age.** AI rewards scale, and the advantage of mega-caps in this respect is becoming deeply entrenched. Microsoft, for instance, has invested tens of billions into OpenAI. Google, Meta, and Amazon are pouring many billions into their own models. These giants have their sights set on owning the entire AI infrastructure, platforms, and ecosystems over coming decades. What will stop them from doing so?

3. **Data/Distribution Moats Will Be Unbridgeable.** The largest mega-caps today are comparable to old giants like Standard Oil. Standard Oil’s unparalleled control of oil enabled it to dominate the energy market in the late 1800s–early 1900s, gaining a near-monopoly and quickly becoming the largest corporation in the U.S. (Standard was dissolved by order of SCOTUS in 1911, but such an ending for the giants of today seems unlikely; we’ve grown tolerant of monopolies.) *Data is the new oil, and the largest mega-caps own the wells.* These companies control consumer platforms and cloud services that generate massive data: e.g. Google Search, YouTube, Amazon e-commerce, Facebook, Instagram, etc. Further, they control distribution channels — operating systems, browsers, cloud platforms. The long term value of these advantages is hard to overstate.

4. **Index Weighting and Capital Flows Feedback Loop.** Passive investing and index weighting dynamics favor the largest companies. As more capital flows into index funds and ETFs, those companies’ prices rise, and their index weight increases, leading to more inflows, which further inflates prices (“passive momentum” feedback loop). *This self-reinforcing cycle will contribute to the growing concentration of wealth in the largest mega-cap equities, accelerating the advantages they already have, boosting R&D investment, and facilitating their ability to acquire any companies that would compete with them.*

5. **As Result, Portfolios Tilting Mega-Cap Will OutPerform.** My argument, then, is that in the coming years and decades, it seems like portfolios that *tilt toward the largest mega-cap stocks* are likely to *outperform* the portfolios lacking such a tilt.

**Please destroy my argument with logic. I’d love to understand why I am wrong.**

Standard Oil’s unparalleled control of oil enabled it to dominate the energy market in the late 1800s–early 1900s, gaining a near-monopoly and quickly becoming the largest corporation in the U.S. (Standard was dissolved by order of SCOTUS in 1911, but such an ending for the giants of today seems unlikely; we’ve grown tolerant of monopolies.) *Data is the new oil, and the largest mega-caps own the wells.* These companies control consumer platforms and cloud services that generate massive data: e.g. Google Search, YouTube, Amazon e-commerce, Facebook, Instagram, etc. Further, they control distribution channels — operating systems, browsers, cloud platforms. The long term value of these advantages is hard to overstate.

4. **Index Weighting and Capital Flows Feedback Loop.** Passive investing and index weighting dynamics favor the largest companies. As more capital flows into index funds and ETFs, those companies’ prices rise, and their index weight increases, leading to more inflows, which further inflates prices (“passive momentum” feedback loop). *This self-reinforcing cycle will contribute to the growing concentration of wealth in the largest mega-cap equities, accelerating the advantages they already have, boosting R&D investment, and facilitating their ability to acquire any companies that would compete with them.*

5. **As Result, Portfolios Tilting Mega-Cap Will OutPerform.** My argument, then, is that in the coming years and decades, it seems like portfolios that *tilt toward the largest mega-cap stocks* are likely to *outperform* the portfolios lacking such a tilt.

**Please destroy my argument with logic. I’d love to understand why I am wrong.**

2025-05-16,Why is Google lagging behind?,"Despite lagging behind Nvidia and Meta since the Liberation Day crash, Google’s strong margins, cloud growth, and undervalued price make it a tempting pick—especially as the cheapest Mag 7 stock; while legal risks and reliance on ads remain, its resilience and brand strength suggest it’s one to watch once the current dip settles.

2025-05-16,"Mega-caps will dominate the market long term (destroy my argument with logic, please)","**Thesis:** The largest mega-cap stocks will consolidate market dominance in the coming decades due to their privileged access to transformative technologies, structural advantages, and capital. Accordingly, portfolios with a bias toward mega-caps will tend to outperform others in the medium-to-long term.

**Argument:**

1. **The Trend Has Already Started.** Over the past ~5 years, U.S. mega-cap stocks have dramatically outperformed the broader market. For instance, the Magnificent Seven have collectively driven the majority of gains in the U.S. equities market (MAGS returned ~103% over past 5 years while QQQ returned ~60% and SPY returned ~41%—and the returns of Nasdaq and S&P would be significantly lower if MAGS’s returns were excluded). *Naturally, past performance is not a meaningful indicator of future performance under normal circumstances.* But I argue we are *not* in normal circumstances, and this trend is not a short-term anomaly. Rather, reflects deeper structural forces that are to likely persist, and even intensify.

2. **Entrenched Scale Advantages in the AI Age.** AI rewards scale, and the advantage of mega-caps in this respect is becoming deeply entrenched. Microsoft, for instance, has invested tens of billions into OpenAI. Google, Meta, and Amazon are pouring many billions into their own models. These giants have their sights set on owning the entire AI infrastructure, platforms, and ecosystems over coming decades. What will stop them from doing so?

3. **Data/Distribution Moats Will Be Unbridgeable.** The largest mega-caps today are comparable to old giants like Standard Oil.

I thought it wouldn’t happen to me. I mean, getting banned from Facebook? Come on — I barely even used Facebook. I bought my Quest 2 back in 2019, and all I really cared about was playing games.

Then, six months ago, I made an Instagram account to fundraise for my brother’s motorcycle accident. That account was temporarily suspended. Because it was linked to my personal Facebook and Instagram, Meta banned everything tied to me.

I appealed the fundraiser account — it was reinstated and is in good standing now. But my personal Facebook? Still banned. My main Instagram? Still banned. My Meta Quest 2? Still locked down. And I’ve got hundreds of dollars in VR games sitting on that account, completely inaccessible.

Every login attempt tells me to appeal a suspension that’s already been resolved. I’ve contacted Meta Store Support. I’ve emailed every Meta address I can find. I’ve filed complaints with the BBB, the Texas Attorney General, and the California Attorney General. I’ve done everything I can — and nothing has worked.

And here’s the kicker: to appeal the Facebook ban, you have to log in. But I’m banned, so I can’t even access the appeal tools. The system is broken, and there’s no one on the other end to fix it.

So yeah, I thought this kind of thing wouldn’t happen. But it did. I’m six months locked out of a headset I paid for and a library I built over four years. No warning, no recourse, no help.

You don’t actually own your Quest. You just own conditional access — and that access can be revoked instantly, without warning, without explanation, and with no way to get it back.

Sure, other platforms like Steam or PlayStation technically reserve the same right. But if something goes wrong there, you can actually contact support. You can talk to a person. You can appeal. 

Meta? Nothing. The only support available through the Meta Store is for hardware defects, shipping issues, or warranty claims. If your account is banned, there is literally no one you can contact unless you live in the EU or pay for Meta Verified. The ""appeal"" option (if you can even get to it) is reviewed by an AI in under 5 minutes, and then that decision is final. That’s it.

So let’s recap: Meta sells full-price games. They lock your entire headset and library to a single account. That account can be banned without cause, by an algorithm. And if it’s banned in error? There’s no appeal. No review. No contact. No options.

That’s not just broken. That’s borderline criminal. You're paying real money for access to digital content that can vanish overnight because their moderation AI made a mistake — and you’re left with nothing but silence.

2025-06-04,On the risks of unregulated brokers and trading software: What MT5 doesn't tell you,"In the world of investing, we're often reminded to do due diligence on asset fundamentals — but sometimes, the platform itself is the risk.



I’d like to flag a lesser-known issue for those exploring Forex and CFD markets: brokers operating through MetaTrader 5 (MT5) — a widely used trading interface — can manipulate user experience through server-side plug-ins. These tools allow a broker to:



Delay or simulate trade execution,



Display artificial spreads or price movement,



Block or stage fake withdrawal processes,



Mimic connection to liquidity providers.



Because MT5 is just software — not a broker or exchange — any entity can license it and operate behind the scenes with zero transparency. The result is a trading environment where your experience is completely controlled by the server owner.



This creates a regulatory blind spot: a user may think they’re trading the real market, but in reality they’re just interacting with a simulation.



Key takeaway for investors:No matter how polished the UI or familiar the platform name, always verify the regulatory status of the entity you’re funding. If possible:



Use demo accounts first,



Check if the broker is regulated by tier-1 financial authorities (FCA, ASIC, etc.),



Compare trade data with public sources like TradingView.



Platform integrity is an overlooked part of investment infrastructure — and it deserves as much scrutiny as the asset itself.",12,37

5. Securing additional funding became impossible during the crash, 
6. [Pets.com](http://Pets.com) goes bankrupt

Now obviously, we are not expecting companies like Google or Microsoft or Meta to go bankrupt. They all have diverse revenue sources and big cash reserves to be able to weather the cash burn. 

However it seems to me those companies going up without a profitable product is clearly reminiscent of the [Pets.com](http://Pets.com) saga, a story of growth at any cost that's bound to crash and burn.

2025-06-08,I agree Meta sucks sometimes but really?,I don't know if I'm being stupid but I feel as no game would be worse for VR as a whole then an exclusive. Agreed a non exclusive would be great but meta probably isn't going to fully fund an IP like this and not make it exclusive other companies also wouldn't do that. Meta is a crappy corporation agreed but if we keep getting backlash like this we will just get NO big games people are looking forward to and VR as a whole won't grow. I would love reasons to be proven wrong but I feel a big exciting VR game is better than no VR game.,133,136
2025-06-08,Meta reportedly in talks to invest over $10B in Scale AI — long-term strategy or another costly pivot?,"Recently, it has been reported that Meta is in advanced negotiations to invest over 10 billion dollars in Scale AI. Scale AI is a company renowned for providing data annotation services, which are crucial for training large-scale artificial intelligence models, including those used by OpenAI.

This potential investment has raised many questions:

Is Meta attempting to establish an internal foundational model system in order to reduce its reliance on external suppliers such as OpenAI and Anthropic?

Does this mean that the focus has shifted from the attention to the metaverse to the emphasis on artificial intelligence infrastructure and vertical integration?

What kind of impact will this have on other stocks related to artificial intelligence? For instance, stocks like $NVDA, $PLTR, or $SNOW?

Given Meta's past performance in major investments, some investors might view it as yet another high-risk bet; while others might see it as a strategic response to the AI competition among large technology companies.",93,37
2025-06-09,Why does Meta not sell movies on the Meta Quest Store?,"This seems like such a basic feature.

I was trying to watch How to Train your Dragon (2010) yesterday on my Meta Quest Pro because I had never watched a movie in VR before and wanted to see what it was like. Turns out I was in for a massive headache. Bought the movie on iTunes (which I have synced to Movies Anywhere) and opened up the YouTube VR app. Navigated over to ‘Movies - Purchased’ and selected HTTYD.

“You cannot consume kid’s content in this app.”

Huh, that’s weird. So I pull up YouTube in the browser and start watching there. However, I notice that the film looks almost unbearably grainy. I check the resolution and notice that it’s capped at 480p for seemingly no reason at all. I start googling and discover an app called Bigscreen but turns out that it requires you to manually download the movie on PC and transfer it to your headset. I have no idea how to even download movie files, let alone how to transfer them.

Least to say, I gave up and just watched it on my TV.

Even the Microsoft Store, which most people forget even exists, sells movies and TV shows. One of the main selling points of a VR headset (as advertised by Meta themselves) is consuming media. Yet, there’s absolutely no native VR movie store. There’s the Meta Quest TV app (which is almost entirely filled with junk), the YouTube app (which you cannot watch kids movies in and the resolution is capped laughably low on some movies), and beyond that there’s apps like Bigscreen where you’re expected to sync to your PC and transfer individual movie files? It’s 2025, you should not have to manually download and manage huge video files just to watch a movie in VR. Most people stream everything these days because of the convenience, and VR should reflect convenience.

Not to be an Apple sheep, but I really think Apple knocked it out of the park with the Apple Vision Pro. In VisionOS, not only do you have access to your entire iTunes library but you also get free 3D (or “spatial”) versions of movies you already own.

But basic stuff like this should not be exclusive to a $3,500 headset.",198,95
2025-06-10,"Zuckerberg, Frustrated by Meta’s “Slow” AI Progress, Personally Hiring New “Superintelligence” AI Team","

Mark Zuckerberg, frustrated with Meta Platforms Inc.’s shortfalls in AI, is assembling a team of experts to achieve artificial general intelligence, recruiting from a brain trust of AI researchers and engineers who’ve met with him in recent weeks at his homes in Lake Tahoe and Palo Alto.

Zuckerberg has prioritized recruiting for the secretive new team, referred to internally as a superintelligence group, according to people familiar with his plans. He has an audacious goal in mind, these people said. In his view, Meta can and should outstrip other tech companies in achieving what’s known as artificial general intelligence or AGI, the notion that machines can perform as well as humans at many tasks. Once Meta reaches that milestone, it could weave the capability into its suite of products — not just social media and communications platforms, but also a range of AI tools, including the Meta chatbot and its AI-powered Ray-Ban glasses.

Zuckerberg aims to hire around 50 people for the new team, including a new head of AI research, almost all of whom he’s recruiting personally. He’s rearranged desks at the company’s Menlo Park headquarters so the new staff will sit near him, the people said, asking to remain anonymous discussing private plans. 

Zuckerberg is building that team in tandem with a planned multi-billion dollar investment in Scale AI, which offers data services to help companies train their models. Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang is expected to join the superintelligence group after a deal is done. Bloomberg News first reported on the deal, set to become Meta’s largest external investment to date. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

Zuckerberg has spoken openly about making artificial intelligence a priority for his company. In the last two months, he’s gone into “founder mode,” according to people familiar with his work, who described an increasingly hands-on management style.

2025-06-10,"As a longtime Meta fan, it’s kinda painful to watch them get leapfrogged on their own ideas","I’ve been rooting for Meta in the mixed reality space for years — bought every headset, defended the Quest line when people called it gimmicky, and genuinely believed they were way ahead of the curve. And they were.

They introduced passthrough before it was cool. They had spatial anchors, MR APIs, room scanning — hell, they demoed widgets on the Quest ages ago. Not to mention the rollout of new features was surprisingly consistent. It really felt like they were building something long-term.

And now? Now I get to watch Apple launch with the one of the main use case that actually feels amazing in MR — immersive movie watching — and do it in a way that just works. Meanwhile, on Quest, I’m still juggling half-baked media apps and sideloading crap.
Then there’s the whole Vision Pro widget system they just showed off, which — let’s not forget — Meta teased long before Apple even showed off their headset. Except, you know, they never shipped it. Because apparently, what’s the rush?

It’s not even that Meta is doing badly. Quest 3 is solid. But it’s like watching a team with the best tech not use it properly, while someone else picks up the playbook and scores first.

I don’t want to switch teams. But damn, it's getting hard not to feel like the underdog fan whose coach keeps sitting on game-winning plays until it’s too late.",448,226
2025-06-10,Meta Set to Throw Billions at Startup That Leads AI Data Market,"Meta is considering investing as much as $10B in AI data company Scale AI, a company they've helped finance in that past to a current tune of $14B.

Created by two founders in their late 20s, Alex Wang and Lisa Guo, Scale AI has sold digging materials to gold miners, using an ""army of contractors"" to label the data that tech firms such as Meta and OpenAI depend on to train and improve their AI models.

Should the financing come to fruition it would become one of the largest private fundings of all time. Although forced out in 2018,  Lisa Guo's stake, due to the company's current valuation, makes her the world's current youngest female billionaire.

What does the sub think of this? Is this Meta making moves to get out ahead in the AI arms race? Or is this another seemingly desperate pivot from a social media giant concerned about future irrelevance?

2025-06-11,Apple + OpenAI and Meta+ Scale vs. Palantir…,"Not really sure, but how does Apple's OpenAI integration play into the enterprise AI race? I know it's mostly consumer-facing for now, but long term… could it lead to broader LLM adoption in enterprise workflows? And if that happens, does it overlap with what Palantir is building through AIP?

2025-06-13,S&P 500 premium is mostly warranted says BofA,"Bank of America analysts argued in a note Friday that the S&P 500’s valuation premium is “mostly warranted,” despite the index appearing expensive by traditional measures.

“The S&P 500 now trades at 21x forward earnings, 35% above average,” BofA wrote, adding that it “looks statistically expensive relative to its own history on all 20 of the valuation metrics we track.”

However, the analysts say comparisons to historical averages may be misleading.

“Today’s S&P is apples vs. prior decades’ oranges,” they said, noting a shift in sector composition.

“Nearly 70% of the index was asset-intensive Manufacturing sectors in 1980 vs. <20% today.”

They argue the index “has become higher quality, with lower leverage, lower earnings volatility, and higher margins.”

BofA also defended the U.S. market’s premium over global peers. “The US trades as the most expensive region (\~40% premium vs. Europe/Asia which trade at 16x),” they noted, but emphasized that “quality, balance sheets, growth potential and risk are statistically superior.”

They pointed to the U.S. being “half as levered as other regions” and praised “significantly lower estimate dispersion on 2025/2026 forecasts.”

Additionally, the U.S. offers “roughly double the long-term growth potential of Asia and Europe, with lower earnings volatility than Europe, plus higher free cash flow per share and a lower percentage of non-earners vs. both Asia and Europe,” says the bank.

BofA also cited structural advantages including “labor fungibility, USD as reserve currency, energy independence, unparalleled liquidity and Tech primacy (at least for now).”

GOOGL, MSFT, NEE, META, BGM, and FCX may benefit from the S&P 500’s sector shift toward higher-quality, capital-light companies, especially in tech, renewables, and metals.

For near-term positioning, BofA’s tactical model prefers U.S. “Communication Services, Utilities and Tech,” and highlights “Interactive Media & Services, Metals & Mining and Independent Power & Renewable Electricity Producers” as top industry opportunities.",146,88

2025-06-18,"Meta to release smart glasses with Oakley and Prada, extending Luxottica partnership","Meta and EssilorLuxottica plan to release versions of their AI-powered smart glasses under the Oakley and Prada brands, CNBC has learned.

The addition of Prada and Oakley underscore the breakout success Meta had with its second-generation Ray-Ban glasses released in partnership with Luxottica in 2023. The Oakley expansion will be done in partnership with Luxottica, while the addition of Prada signifies Meta’s first step toward bring its wearable hardware to more fashion companies. 

Meta on Monday teased the Oakley release on social media, launching an Instagram account for “Oakley | Meta” with a profile description that reads “The next evolution is coming on June 20.”

CNBC reviewed a document that says the new glasses with Luxottica will be aimed at athletes. Meta is targeting active consumers after seeing several owners of its Ray-Ban glasses use the device to record themselves playing tennis, skiing and doing other activities.

The Oakley version of the glasses may cost around $360 as they are more weather resistant than their Ray-Ban counterparts, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about the upcoming device. The first version of the Oakley Meta glasses will feature similar technology to the Ray-Ban Meta glasses released in 2023.

Luxottica, based in France and Italy, has licensing arrangements with over 150 brands and owns notable brands including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear and Persol.

Meta’s agreement with Prada comes after the fashion company in December renewed an eyewear-related licensing agreement with Luxottica for 10 years. That deals covers the “development, production and worldwide distribution of eyewear under the Prada, Prada Linea Rossa and Miu Miu brands,” the companies said at the time.

Besides giving Meta a high-end partnership, the Prada glasses may be a particularly good fit for the tech company as many of the brand’s models come with thick temples, former Meta employees said. That provides more heft for housing many of the components necessary for smart glasses, including microphones and chips.

It’s unclear when the Prada deal and product line will be announced.

Meta first partnered with EssilorLuxottica in 2019 to jointly develop the Ray-Ban glasses. The two companies released the first version in 2021, but they found success after the release of the second-generation Ray-Ban Meta glasses in 2023. That version comes equipped with the Meta AI voice assistant and includes features and, when tethered to a smartphone, lets users identify city landmarks, get recipes when looking at ingredients and record and send voice messages on WhatsApp and Messenger.

EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said in February the companies have sold 2 million pairs of the Meta Ray-Ban glasses since 2023. Miller said he aimed to increase annual production to 10 million units by the end of 2026.

Meta and Luxottica announced an extension of their partnership in October, with plans to release more versions of their Ray-Ban glasses. That deal was worth $5 billion, according to a July 2024 report in The Wall Street Journal. As part of the deal, Meta gets exclusive rights to Luxottica’s brands for its smart glasses technology for a number of years, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. 

The two companies plan to release a bulkier, third generation of their glasses in time for the coming holiday season. The new device is expected to include a small display in one of the lenses, CNBC has previously reported.

Competition in the market is heating up.

Last month, Alphabet announced a $150 million partnership with Warby Parker that will see the two companies team up to release glasses infused with Google’s Gemini AI assistant. The companies plan to release the glasses sometime after 2025. 

Snap, meanwhile, announced in June that it plans to release its sixth generation smart glasses under a new brand called Specs. Those glasses, expected for release in 2026, will include augmented-reality technology and will be smaller and lighter than Snap’s prior products, Snap said. 

Meta declined to comment. Luxottica and Prada could not be reached.

* Its operating margins are improving - from 5% in 2022 to over 10% in 2025. In my model, I assume margins continue to rise and eventually settle around 18%. That’s still modest compared to Google (\~32%) and Meta (\~41%).
* Revenue is driven by two key metrics: Ad Clicks and CPCs (cost per click)
* Ad Clicks increased in 2024, but CPCs remained flat. I found that a bit odd, especially since the number of businesses advertising on Yelp has slightly declined. My theory: Yelp is doing some search arbitrage - buying cheap clicks on platforms such as Google/Meta, then reselling that traffic through its own higher-priced sponsored listings. 
* Lastly, Yelp is a controversial company - [South Park once dedicated an entire episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_Not_Yelping) to mocking it and there's even a Kickstarter-funded documentary called - [Billion Dollar Bully ](https://tubitv.com/movies/520879/billion-dollar-bully) \- that questions its business practices.  Online forums are littered with accusations of pushy sales tactics and pay-to-play schemes. Yelp denies these allegations, and to be fair, has never been reprimanded by the courts. They operate in a tricky area of maintaining a ""fair"" review system, so this kinda backlash isn't totally unexpected. 

Based on my analysis, I think Yelp is worth about $38/share  - with upside scenarios pushing it past $40. It's currently trading at $34/share. 

Would love to hear what ya'll think. Yelp in not a buzzy stock anymore but there might be some hidden value here. ",0,19

2025-06-23,Is It Actually Moral and Good to Invest In Evil Companies?,"There is an assumption for most people that ethical investing involves not investing in companies that one deems (personally) immoral. The types of companies one deems immoral will be different for every investor, but is not important for this question. Question is: For someone that cares about a certain issue, is it actually *better* to invest in that company, reap the rewards, and then use the rewards for your cause, than to not invest at all?

  
For example, let's say your biggest issue is climate change. If you invest, let's say, $1K in Exxon Mobil, the benefit to Exxon is essentially *nil*\---you are buying the stock from another person, not the company; the only real impact is a totally negligible increase to the share price (I guess... And I guess of like a theoretical 0.00000000000000000000001%?). A few years later, you sell your investment, which is now worth $1.5K. With the $500 profit, you can donate to a green energy non-profit, use the money to help buy solar panels, etc..---direct forms of support which almost certainly have a much greater positive effect than the buying of the stock had a negative effect. So essentially you are buying a stock from someone (who is probably pro-fossil fuels, and whose consumption patterns would probably align to that---i.e., would use the money they make to make the problem even worse) and now having it be owned by yourself, who will take the increased valuation of this company over time and use it *against them* at a much higher impact multiplier.

  
What are the problems with this argument? I'm not sure I totally agree with it, but I currently find it at least as persuasive as the ""investing in bad stock = bad because complicit"" argument.",0,28

2025-06-23,Advice about ethical investing?,"
So, for context, I’m from Spain and almost 30. I started investing around two years ago, when I didn’t really know how it worked. My biggest investment was my current house, which I bought for around 200,000€, and I’ve also put some money into the stock market sporadically (around 3,000€ total), investing in the classics like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Coca-Cola, by buying individual stocks through Revolut, not funds or ETFs. 

I never invested in Tesla, Netflix, and some other companies because they go against my values (Elon Musk, subscription services, gas or arms companies, etc.). But over time, I’ve realized that many of the companies I have invested in don’t align with my morals either, especially after some of them publicly supported Trump (Meta, Amazon, etc.) or Israel (Carrefour, McDonald’s, and many more).

Now I’m dealing with an internal conflict. I want to make money, but not by supporting unethical companies. I’ve noticed that a lot of funds and ETFs also include these companies in different proportions, and the ones that don’t often don’t perform well. So it’s hard to find ways to invest that feel both profitable and principled.

I guess my questions are: how do you align your values with your investments? Do you think there’s a middle ground, and if so, how do you find it? Do you have any recommendations for specific companies, funds, or ETFs that are both ethical and profitable? Or would it make more sense to put the money into a high-yield savings account, crypto, gold, or something else?

All feedback is welcome.

2025-07-02,how do you invest for the singularity,"I am convinced that we will probably reach AGI (artificial general intelligence) in less than 5 years, and ASI (artificial super intelligence/ ai smarter than all humans) shortly after.  
However, looking around, it seems to me that ordinary people are extremely underestimating the pace of AI progress and, above all, its capacity to transform the world.  
But this has been discussed often here. What I want to ask you instead is: how can I leverage this intuition?  
The best way I've thought of is investing. If AI has the ability to radically change the world and replace most jobs, then it will also be worth a ridiculous amount of money.  
Giving a precise estimate is impossible, but it doesn't seem hard to imagine that an ASI capable of creating fusion reactors, immortality (rejuvenation), and hundreds of new materials could be worth tens or hundreds of [trillions.So](http://trillions.so/), I started investing and learning about this world, but it seems to me that most of the advice, principles, and metrics used are useless.  
Things like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and growth prospects are not useful if an ASI is created.  
Even among funds dedicated to AI companies and among investors betting on AI, it seems to me that they are still thinking with the wrong mindset.  
In fact, as soon as an ASI is created, a lot of companies will lose their value very quickly.  
What is the value of Nvidia if an ASI creates a better chip in 2 months? What value can software have (Office, Windows, whatever Palantir does) if an AI can program a custom operating system in half a day?  
Therefore, in my opinion, the logic for a long-term investment should be:

1. The quantity of physical resources available (datacenters, foundries, power plants, robots).
2. The ability to be the first (or among the first) to develop an AGI/ASI.

Based on these principles, I believe the best companies for the long term are:  
Google, ASML (creates the machines to make chips), TSMC, Amazon (owns a bit of Anthropic, and a bit of Digit (robots)), Microsoft (OpenAI, servers), Meta (although I doubt their ability to reach AGI first), Intel (foundries), Tesla (humanoid robots).

A possible problem with investing, however, is that we will most likely see a recession caused by job losses. It would be a great shame to invest now and not wait for the probable crash.What do you think? How are you approaching investments?",0,30

Inevitably, this broke last week (batch file window giving ""cannot start client"" error if anyone knows what's up).

Virtual Desktop can't even attempt to utilize usb because Meta won't give them low level usb connection access, so wifi is the only way they support.

After googling I'm now copying modified batch files or considering looking at the source code myself with almost 0 clue what to do.  It's that, or I spend $80-$100 on dedicated wifi hardware, introduce another point of complexity and failure, and use Virtual Desktop over wifi while my headset is plugged in for charging.  

The router money isn't the end of the world, and remarkably, the performance is genuinely phenomenal, like 1-2 ms of extra lag in typical conditions compared to a usb connection(again shoutout to Virtual Desktop).  I'm really against having to spend more to introduce more complexity when VR in general is such a mess to get working.  I grant that I'm overblowing the chance that wireless causes me problems, but I do networking for work and I know how wifi can get goofed up and I avoid relying on it whenever I can.  

So today I sulk back and install Meta Quest Link, and after several tries, rebooting my PC once and my quest several times, like usual, PC Link finally connects and appears to work, for now.  But I know its going to get broken again and I'm going to have to hope my gnirehtet error magically goes away between now and then, or get wifi6 router, but why does it have to be this bad?

I have gone through the Forbes billionaires list and fished out all businesses responsible for their founders/staff being billionaires under the age of 50.

2025-07-10,Meta’s $3.5 Billion Bet on EssilorLuxottica: Why Your Next Pair of Glasses Might Be Smarter Than Your Phone,"Meta’s latest move sees it quietly acquire a roughly three-percent stake in EssilorLuxottica for about $3.5 billion, deepening a partnership that began in 2019 with the first Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses. This isn’t a one-off equity play but a strategic bet on owning more of the hardware pipeline for AI-powered eyewear rather than relying on third-party manufacturers [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zuckerbergs-meta-reportedly-takes-stake-in-ray-ban-maker-showing-commitment-to-ai-powered-smartglasses-4d4e812d?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

By embedding itself in the world’s biggest eyewear company, Meta is aiming to accelerate development of smartglasses that can livestream, translate languages on the fly, and serve as lightweight AR companions instead of bulky VR headsets. Reality Labs has burned through tens of billions in losses chasing the Metaverse dream, but smartglasses have sold more than two million units and promise to bridge the gap to mainstream adoption.

The immediate market reaction was a five-percent pop in EssilorLuxottica’s share price, reflecting investor belief that Meta’s backing will speed production capacity from two million to ten million pairs by 2026. Competitors from Google to Xiaomi are racing to enter the AI wearables fray, but Meta’s equity cushion and deep pockets give it a home-court advantage in shaping design, distribution and software integration.

For end users and developers alike this signals a coming wave of smarter, sleeker eyewear packed with AI features that could redefine how we capture memories, navigate cities or even interact with the digital world. By putting real dollars behind high-fashion names like Prada and Oakley as well as Ray-Ban, Meta is signaling that the next revolution in personal tech won’t be on your wrist or in your pocket but right in front of your eyes.

  
Do you think your next notification will show up on your glasses instead of your phone?",37,32
2025-07-11,Meta needs to fix the resale loophole on Quest devices,"I want to bring attention to a growing issue that’s affecting honest secondhand buyers — and one that Meta really needs to address if they care about their ecosystem and community trust.

I recently bought a **Meta Quest 3** through **Facebook Marketplace**. The seller provided the **original Meta Store receipt**, everything looked completely legit. The device was unopened, sealed, activated without any issues. For a few days, it worked perfectly.

Then, without warning, the device was **remotely blocked** by Meta.

I contacted Meta support and was told that the **original buyer (the seller)** had filed a **“lost in shipping” claim** and received a **full refund**. Because of that, Meta had flagged the headset’s serial number as **“lost/stolen”** and **bricked the device** remotely — making it unusable, even though I’m now the legal, physical owner.

They refused to unblock the device.

Meanwhile, the seller won’t respond or take the item back. They got a full refund from Meta *and* my money — essentially profiting off fraud.

# This is how the scam works:

1. A person buys a Quest 3 from the Meta Store.
2. They receive it normally.
3. Then they file a false \*\*“item lost in transit”\*\*claim with Meta and get a **refund**.
4. Meta assumes the device never arrived, flags the serial number as lost/stolen.
5. The scammer then sells the **now-doomed**headset on a resale platform like Facebook Marketplace, eBay, or OfferUp.
6. The buyer (me) ends up with a blocked headset and no support or protection.

#  Why this matters:

This is a **known loophole**, and it puts all secondhand buyers at risk. Meta has no policy or system in place to:

* Verify secondhand ownership.
* Allow license transfers or reactivations.
* Offer protection or appeal for good-faith buyers caught in the middle.

At the same time, **scammers are taking advantage of Meta’s own return policies** — and Meta is doing nothing to close the gap. The result? Honest customers are left holding bricked hardware, with no way to appeal, no protection, and no support.

#  What Meta should do:

1. **Allow secondhand ownership registration**(transferable accounts or licenses, like Apple’s Activation Lock).
2. **Add serial number lookups for buyers**— let people verify if a device is flagged before purchase.
3. **Reevaluate the policy of remote bricking when there’s conflicting ownership**.
4. **Track repeat fraudulent refund claims from the same accounts.**

It shouldn’t be this easy for someone to double-dip and scam both Meta and an unsuspecting buyer, while Meta washes its hands of the problem.

If Meta doesn’t acknowledge this loophole and start building better protections, it’s going to erode trust in their hardware and community-driven resale market.

To anyone buying secondhand: **double-check everything**. Don't trust receipts alone. And unless Meta builds some safeguards, understand that there’s no safety net if something goes wrong.

To Meta: **please don’t keep punishing the victims. Give secondhand buyers the tools to protect themselves — and shut this loophole down.**",429,143

TSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.

PLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.

GOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.

AAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.

AMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.

MSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.

I personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted.

The Meta platforms, as they exist today, have begun to stagnate—they're nothing but commercial hellscape these days. His dream/quest is to convert the billions of current eyeballs into an AI-controlled dystopia with AI friends/assistants recommending products and services not to mention the stupid Metaverse idea, but if after dumping $100s of billions into CapEx these last several years, he's probably now realizing he doesn't have the right solutions and these latest moves reek of panic and desperation in my opinion.

2025-07-30,"Premise: AI is not a bubble, it's a binary event","The binary event is whether the hundreds of billions or even trillions invested in AI either A) provides a good roic or B) does not provide a good roic.

Companies like meta have been investing massively in AI.  Companies like Nvidia have benefited massively from the capex from companies like meta.

So the premise follows that if meta has been making poor investments they will be punished when it's discovered.  And the discovery that investment into AI offers poor roic means Nvidia will see massive reductions in revenue and margins.

Companies focused on electrification, data center build out, etc have also seen growth and multiple expansion from the AI build out.  That is to say the ramifications of the AI capex spend is far reaching and has large effect on the current earnings and projected growth in the markets beyond Nvidia and meta.

And this premise goes both ways, if hundreds of billions or even trillions invested provides a good roic growth will be massive.  If meta gets a 10% roic on $500B it would add $50B to operating income, nearly doubling their current!

And thus it acts like a binary event.  Thumbs down it could take the market years to achieve the same earnings as today, potentially a lost decade.  Thumbs up and we'll be talking about how cheap these $1-4T valuations were.

2025-07-30,[DD] You Should Probably Not Listen to Most DD Posts Here,"TL;DR: Due Diligence posts do not on average predict stock performance any better than random choice

Greetings degenerates. I preface this message by flouting my credentials as a professional quant, yet here I am in the pits of hell nevertheless. I was fascinated by some of absolutely absurd gains coming out of stocks in the very short-term following DD posts here and was wondering if there was a genuine short-term correlation. 

I analyzed 245 DD posts across WSB since December of 2024, scraping a total of 499 different instances of tickers (an instance being a ticker mention in a DD post, the date of the post, and the sentiment associated to the ticker - extracted using Mistral 8x22). Across each ticker reference, I calculated 1-day, 3-day, 5-day, 10-day, and 30-day returns relative to the S&P 500, and let's just say... not great. Graph time:

""Oh, but u/Chocolate_Jesus_"", you're not removing hype posts following an original DD. Wouldn't your analysis be better suited looking at the first instance of a DD post?"". Shut up, I know. The graphs look exactly the same - I promise, I just am not going to spam 10 identical looking histograms. 

You can take a look at the significance testing for the deduplicated results below, though (notice how bullish stocks *underperform* the S&P already after 30 days - although this is not significant):

To the surprise of nobody, there doesn't seem to be a profitable algorithmic strategy from sentiment analysis of this place. Who'd've thunk.

That's not to say good DD isn't valueless, but that you should make sure you can tell good DD apart from bad DD before you go ramming your Roth IRA into a pump and dump for the 9th time this year thinking ""this is the one"".

2025-07-30,Meta Capex and Opex will shake Wallstreet to the core.,"(post translate and enhanced with AI) 

The AI fever continues driving the market to record highs.

After blowing through $60 billion on the Metaverse, Zuckerberg is now racing to lead the charge for super intelligence and infinite gains.

While I'm somewhat skeptical about this strategy of hiring a bunch of rockstar researchers who have never worked together and expecting them to perform miracles, we all have to admire Zuck's boldness.

But my point here is about whether Wall Street truly understands the magnitude of spending that Meta is committing to, and how this will affect financial results in the coming months and years.

I can't think of any similar example other than Meta itself between 2019 and 2022 with the Metaverse. And even this seems to be an order of magnitude larger.

Perhaps a similar positive example would be Microsoft's pivot to the Cloud in 2012. But in that situation, there was only one major competitor (AWS).

To wrap up: I expect that tomorrow we'll see much stronger movements in companies like Nvidia, AMD, Dell, IBM on the upside and Google and Oracle on the downside.

Meta stock jumped more than 8% immediately following the announcement.

A global pandemic that shut the world down couldn't do it (SPY found a new high within 6 months).

Global conflict cannot do it -- the world is as to nuclear war as it's been since the collapse of the USSR.

Ridiculous valuations cannot do it -- The SPY is trading at a P/E that was only higher during dot com, GFC, and for one quarter after COVID hit -- at any point in the last 125+ years.

Bank failures cannot do it -- The failures of signature bank, silicon valley bank, and first republic banks, by assets under management, were larger than all the bank failures combined of the +/- 450 banks that failed in 08.

Rising delinquency rates in auto loans and credit card debt, paired with the highest balances on consumer debt in history have no effect.

A failing commercial real estate sector has no impact.

High interest rates, paired with an unaffordability crisis in the housing sector, means that a majority of Americans can no longer afford to buy a home... irrelevant.

Global trade wars that tank the market 20% only have the ability to hold that price action for 4 months before the market finds new highs.

Meta seem to have moved to a business model that promotes spamming the store and my feed with garbage Worlds. I've tried giving some a go, to see if I can understand why Meta is pushing this corner of their platform so hard, but holy shit... these are some of the worst ""games"" the internet has to offer. Most of them look like prototypes at best, with gameplay as shallow as a puddle.

The reason in my opinion why this is killing VR, at least for Meta, is the sheer saturation of Horizon Worlds on the store front. They're watering down their library with utter trash. Half of them aren't even for VR, they're exclusive for mobile. 90% of the thumbnails are AI generated, and there's no screenshots! 

Imagine you're a new VR user, jumping onto the store to grab a game, and the bulk of your experiences are Horizon Worlds. You'd probably sell your VR headset.",611,156

2025-08-14,$3M on Unity - My DD for U,"**Position**     

3000 call options for January 2026 with a 30 USD strike price; you can also see in my previous postings that I hadn’t sold when we were at almost $40 and then when it went all the way down, I added to my Unity position. 

  
**Disclaimer**

This isn’t financial advice. This is all just for your entertainment.

**TLDR of the TLDR**

Unity can do an AppLovin stock move if Unity’s new AI-Powered ad Platform Vector succeeds. So far, Vector has “far exceeded our expectations” according to the CEO Bromberg 1 week ago. My 1 year price target is $200. That would represent around half of AppLovin’s current market cap; their main competitor in the ad space. Unity powers 70% of mobile games with their engine (Unity software is on 2.5 billion devices - you read that right, read it again and maybe one more time. This also includes the China market… ), but until Vector they haven’t really capitalized on this potential moat. In the short-term gamma squeezes and even a short squeeze (9.28% shorted) are possible because various whales are buying OTM call options en masse and up to 88.26% of Unity is institutionally held and most positions have been made when the stock was over $100 (according to Fintel) which creates illiquidity as institutions likely won’t want to sell a turn-around stock in a bull market when they are still in the minus. In other words, if you bet on Unity, you are riding together with the whales. And if you think gaming has a future and ads will play a role, especially on mobile phones and VR (60% of VR games are made with Unity), and you are still here, you might as well read my intro and the TLDR. 

  
[https://images.fintel.io/us-u-so.png](https://images.fintel.io/us-u-so.png) 

  
**About me**

I went from 27k to 5M+ in less than 2 years (see my previous posts on WSB), but I also lost 180k back in the SPAC days and had to start again from scratch. This taught me that I should only invest in undervalued  companies that have some sort of actual moat. Previously I went with long-term calls into PLTR at around $8 and then into SOFI at around $7 (which btw at that time people also argued were overvalued). Unity is my third and only play. The rest I have in cash. My life hasn’t changed much (only my parents know and 2 friends), but whatever happens, I’ll be able to create an animal shelter for homeless dogs and other animals. 

**TLDR**

Unity is a turn-around, it has almost 0 interest from the retail community (try yourself and search on YouTube or X if anything received lots of interactions in the recent 1-2 years. This is good, because we are so early that no popular finfluencer is covering it), it’s actually even hated among retail because of Unity’s previous management and its runtime fee non-sense. Since their new CEO Bromberg took over 15 months ago, Unity not only reversed the runtime fee decisions, but also double beat on their earnings each time. Last week they did it again and analysts all upgraded Unity stock based on the most recent quarter. Still the stock is beaten down when you look at the 5 year chart (Unity used to trade above $200). I am not a technical trader, but I like beaten down stocks that are in the accumulation zone for years while the underlying company double beats each quarter and keeps growing. I like it even more when we are now witnessing the first great results of an AI product that hasn’t even started yet - Vector. It reminds me of when Palantir introduced their AIP bootcamps, their game changer. Ok, I tricked you. The TLDR of the TLDR and this TLDR are actually just an introduction. You might as well read the rest now. At least try to read the next sentence and see if it gets you hooked for more. 

**AppLovin, Unity’s main competitor**

AppLovin (Ticker APP - check out what their stock did in the last 12 months as inspiration) tried to buy Unity in 2022 for $58.85 per share and Unity rejected because they much rather wanted to compete with AppLovin in ads since Unity has the better moat (they provide the engine on which the games run). Based on some rumors they tried buying them a second time last year. However often AppLovin really tried to buy Unity, I am relieved that I could still invest in Unity. 

**Secret whale(s)**

In the background there’s an investor or multiple investors that have been putting $40M+ in the last few weeks on Unity OTM call options. Whoever that is, they got balls of steel as they are riding all ups and downs like a madman and keep accumulating. Yesterday alone around $10M was added to this Friday’s options chain. If Unity holds above $37.50 until Friday, we might see a gamma squeeze. Also, with up to 90% institutional ownership, where the majority is way underwater, thus likely not selling (which makes the stock illiquid) and Unity being almost 10% shorted, we might see a short squeeze. It’s not my main investment thesis, but definitely fun to watch this unfold. It’s still a big if, so don’t bet on it.      

**Unity and AppLovin experts**

If you don’t believe me because I am just claiming to be a wizard and can’t even write wizard, make sure to invest 3 hours of your time to watch 2 podcasts of the GameMakers (one is from Apr 8, 2025 and the other one is from June 10th, 2025; you can find it on YT) and watch how they are slowly changing their opinion full of skepticism towards Unity’s new Vector platform to seeing some potential opportunity for Unity to then 5 days ago Josh Chandley, Co-Founder at WildCard (mobile) Games, posting this:

And have a look who is liking this. Multiple employees in senior roles at Unity wouldn’t outright confirm any numbers obviously (they like to sandbag and then doublebeat at the earnings). So, feel free to have a look at this LinkedIn posting and check for yourself how many Unity employees liked that posting. It’s around 50+ Unity employees. Here’s one senior employee:

**Unity partners**

Not surprisingly as the biggest engine provider in the world Unity is partnered with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nintendo, Meta (for the Oculus) and Sony (for the PlayStation), but also with Tencent to help developers bring more games to China. They are also partnered with lots of other companies, even multiple car manufacturers (Mercedes-Benz, Toyota etc.) to create 3D models.

**Macro cycle**

We never know what Trump is up to and if we will get the next recession this year, next year or with the next president. But what we know is that we are at all-time-highs. Typically in all-time-highs the more speculative and smaller cap stocks go up. Unity fundamentally isn’t a highly speculative stock, but it is perceived as one. So, even if you think that we will soon have a recession, Unity might as well go up in the short-term. For the intermediate term in case of a recession, millions of people losing their jobs would cause what? 4 years ago when people lost their jobs and were at home they were playing (mobile) games and many programmers also created games. This was the time when Unity stock was above $200. And now with generative AI it will be even easier to create new mobile games. Unity is still the best game engine for new developers. In short, I am not too worried about Unity even if a recession hits anytime soon.  

**Unity red flag:**

Yes, I am honest here. There’s also something critical about Unity. I am fine with stock-based-compensation. That’s normal for such companies to keep talent and attract more talent. But when I read through Glassdoor reviews, Unity employees emphasize the great work-life-balance… Sorry, but if any Unity employees read this: AppLovin has eaten your breakfast, lunch and dinner in the last few years. True, you previously had really bad management. But now with your CEO Bromberg and Vector you have a real chance to eat their dessert. That’s the best food anyway. So, in the next 9-12 months keep pushing like never before to get it! I believe in unity. You have been waiting for this long enough.   ",1345,342

2025-08-24,Trying to overhaul my IRA and taxable brokerage account with a focus on AI divestment,"I’m looking for a gut-check on a simple plan. I have an IRA (\~$80k) and a taxable brokerage (\~$267k) with Morgan Stanley. Both are managed accounts. Right now about 60% of the portfolio equity is effectively tied to big tech/AI (mag7). I’d like to cut that concentration, move to a fund-only setup, and keep costs low. Also somewhat of a hedge towards AI bubble burst.

Target mix (household level)

* 75% U.S. large cap
   * 50% core (S&P 500 or total market: VOO/VTI or equivalents)
   * 25% “top-7 light” allocation to reduce reliance on AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA (leaning XMAG; open to RSP if that’s cleaner)
* 25% diversifiers
   * 10% value (VTV or IWD)
   * 5% mid cap (VO or IJH)
   * 4% small cap (VB or IJR)
   * 6% international (VXUS or IXUS)

How I’d implement

* IRA: start with XMAG only (no S&P/total market in IRA) to cut the mega-cap tilt fast with no tax hit. 
* Taxable: keep the S&P/total-market core (VOO/VTI) and systematically exit all single-stock positions, prioritizing the big tech names first. Do it tax-sensitively with about $10–15k per year in realized gains, have dividends go to cash to fund the new ETFs, and aim to finish in roughly three years.

My rationale for this vs just holding S&P 500?

* Keeps broad U.S. exposure but dials down single-name risk.
* XMAG (or equal-weight) helps with the current top-heavy market.
* The diversifier slice is pretty boilerplate imo. 

Questions:

1. Does this combo (core + XMAG + value/mid/small/international) seem like a sensible way to cut big-tech exposure? Not a full divestment (though I'd like to - it's too risky of a bet), but a reduction in overexposure.
2. For placement, would you park value/mid/small in the IRA and leave international in taxable for the foreign tax credit, or is that not worth optimizing?
3. Is \~$10–15k per year in realized gains and a \~3-year glidepath a reasonable way to unwind single stocks in taxable?
4. End stage I'd like to remove the ""managed"" signifier from these two accounts entirely. Has anyone had luck asking for a reduced brokerage fee or flat/retainer model for the advisors? How would you recommend I broach this full strategy with them?
5. Should I deploy something similar with my 403b (if the available funds allow)?
6. Anything else I'm missing?",18,7

I have an IRA (\~$80k) and a taxable brokerage (\~$267k) with Morgan Stanley. Both are managed accounts. Right now about 60% of the portfolio equity is effectively tied to big tech/AI (mag7). I’d like to cut that concentration, move to a fund-only setup, and keep costs low. Also somewhat of a hedge towards AI bubble burst.

Target mix (household level)

* 75% U.S. large cap
   * 50% core (S&P 500 or total market: VOO/VTI or equivalents)
   * 25% “top-7 light” allocation to reduce reliance on AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA (leaning XMAG; open to RSP if that’s cleaner)
* 25% diversifiers
   * 10% value (VTV or IWD)
   * 5% mid cap (VO or IJH)
   * 4% small cap (VB or IJR)
   * 6% international (VXUS or IXUS)

How I’d implement

* IRA: start with XMAG only (no S&P/total market in IRA) to cut the mega-cap tilt fast with no tax hit. 
* Taxable: keep the S&P/total-market core (VOO/VTI) and systematically exit all single-stock positions, prioritizing the big tech names first. Do it tax-sensitively with about $10–15k per year in realized gains, have dividends go to cash to fund the new ETFs, and aim to finish in roughly three years.

My rationale for this vs just holding S&P 500?

* Keeps broad U.S. exposure but dials down single-name risk.
* XMAG (or equal-weight) helps with the current top-heavy market.
* The diversifier slice is pretty boilerplate imo. 

Questions:

1. Does this combo (core + XMAG + value/mid/small/international) seem like a sensible way to cut big-tech exposure? Not a full divestment (though I'd like to - it's too risky of a bet), but a reduction in overexposure.
2. For placement, would you park value/mid/small in the IRA and leave international in taxable for the foreign tax credit, or is that not worth optimizing?
3. Is \~$10–15k per year in realized gains and a \~3-year glidepath a reasonable way to unwind single stocks in taxable?
4. End stage I'd like to remove the ""managed"" signifier from these two accounts entirely. Has anyone had luck asking for a reduced brokerage fee or flat/retainer model for the advisors? How would you recommend I broach this full strategy with them?
5. Should I deploy something similar with my 403b (if the available funds allow)?

2025-08-26,A user just got some comments removed from **my own** posting history (not just from a thread). How is this technically possible?,"This thread is to ask how a third party was able to remove comments from my Reddit posting history. 

I'm not linking to the involved content because another user seems to be going after me with some success (possibly at Reddit admin level), so it makes no sense to expose myself to recriminations. You either take my word for it or you don't (evaluate from my 9 year posting history). I'm basically asking if the following kind of sequence is *technically* possible. For TL;DR purposes, you can skip to point 9 below.

1. I saw a thread title and text in Italian on an English-Language space tech subreddit that I follow. 
2. I used an auto- translate service to read.
3. Saw that the content was highly embarrassing and suggested serious psychological problems, so felt concern for the poster. 
4. I checked his [he identifies as a man] posting history and saw user posting all over Reddit in Italian on English Language subreddits, and his only use of English was (according to them) by getting a LLM to post for him. All their interactions with other users were conflictual. However, he is mostly ignored or has his threads removed. 
5. I replied to the user expressing my concerns in English, adding an auto-translate to Italian. 
6. I saw another user expressing concern as I had *""Hey man, are you okay? do you need to talk to someone?""*. I replied to that user agreeing that there really seems to be something wrong, and maybe the conversation needed to be removed by the mods, then kept private.
7. I reported to the mods.
8. The italien user saw my comment and replied that he'd taken action against me to protect himself [considers himself persecuted].
9. I saw that all my comments were removed from the thread and the user had blocked at account level.
10. Checking my posting history, I found that **the same comments had also been removed from my Reddit posting history**. 

Of course I'll be more careful in my interactions with a deranged user next time. That includes when I'm concerned for their well-being.

My question remains: How did a third party get into my own posting history and does this mean that the user manage to get the admins to side with him?

The same happened when Netflix was at 180, when people were saying Netflix cancelled too many shows therefore the company has a failing strategy.

I have the same feeling right now about Ubisoft, which has historically a very low market cap at 1.2 billion.  People seem to hate this company for personal reasons, same hate that EA (43 billion) and Activision got some time ago. Youtubers are making bank selling anti-woke Ubisoft hate.

At the same time, Tencent recently invested at 4x the value, it sells at right now. So they must be seeing some potential.

2025-09-02,Ready to Consolidate: How Would You Simplify This Portfolio?,"On a monthly basis I I’ve been buying and holding a wide range of stocks, ETFs, and some crypto, but at this point my portfolio feels scattered and overly complicated. I’m interested in consolidating or simplifying my holdings and would appreciate any recommendations or tips from those who have gone through this process. How did you approach streamlining your portfolio? What did you focus on keeping or letting go? Any pitfalls to avoid?

I know my crypto position is high but I stopped my monthly contributions until I’m at about 5%. 

Stocks – 55.77%:
- TSM, META, NVDA, AMZN, AMD, GOOGL, AAPL, SOFI, PLTR, UNH, CRSP, O

ETFs – 24.41%:
- QQQ, SCHD, VTI, ESPO, NUKZ, BND, TAN, DRIV, JEPI, QTUM, SPMO

2025-09-04,"$10,526 to $1,500,000 in 5 months thanks Google!","This account started the year with around $150,000 and I was playing NVDA. The stock tanked with everything else in April during liberation day and I was down to $526. I had to deposit another $10,000 to pick myself up and take revenge on the market. 

Luckily I caught Google on the dip to 148 and I had conviction that Google was going to the moon based on its P/E and great ai plays. 

I kept buying 5% otm calls 30 days out on red days and selling when the calls were in the money. Then I would open another position with more and more contracts every time. 

The last push was this weekend before Labor Day I held $450,000 cash and unloaded it on the dip Monday at 207 and bought $4.70 950 contracts of 220 strike calls for 10/17. Those calls were up $91,000 end of the day as you can see from my previous post. Today I sold at $16 per contract. ",24951,1260

2025-09-04,"Within 1 year, or less... we won't know if any of us are Human or Bot. A far many most will be OK of that, or completely ignorant to the fact, like they are today. But the rest of humanity will be completely unsure who we ask or debate online are even Human.","**The Disappearing Human: Are Bots About to Take Over Reddit?**

I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and honestly it’s starting to feel like Reddit might be on the edge of something pretty big (and not in a good way). Within a year, it’s going to be really hard—maybe impossible—to tell if you’re talking to another person or just some AI bot.

Everyone knows the “bot problem” here isn’t new. We’ve had repost bots, karma farms, low-effort accounts forever. Back in the day it was easy to spot them: repetitive comments, usernames that looked like they were just banged out on a keyboard, weird posting times. But that’s not really the case anymore. With LLMs and AI tools getting better every week, those obvious signs are fading.

What’s happening is kind of a feedback loop. AI models scrape tons of human content (including from Reddit), learn to mimic it better, then start generating content that feels human. That new content gets scraped again, and the cycle repeats. It’s not just spam anymore, it’s full on conversation. Bots can now write on-topic, sometimes even witty comments, respond to criticism, and sound like they know what they’re talking about.

The scary part is what this means for the community itself. Reddit’s always been valuable because it’s full of real people sharing experiences, advice, and perspectives. But if you can’t be sure the person you’re replying to is even real, that value kinda collapses.

Now, does Reddit have a strong reason to fight this? I’m not sure. More bots means more engagement numbers, more traffic, and that looks good for investors after the IPO. Actually spending money to build strong bot detection would be expensive, and it might make user counts look worse than they want to show.

For us users, though, the impact is bigger. You’ve probably heard of the “dead internet theory”—the idea that most of the internet is already AI generated and we just don’t realise it. I don’t think it’s *that* far yet, but it’s definately trending that way. The more inauthentic interactions we recieve, the more trust gets eroded. And once people stop trusting each other, what’s even left?

Sure, some of the hardcore bot hunters can still find patterns—posting frequency, weird context misses, stuff like that. But the truth is detection methods fall behind faster every month. It’s going to turn into a game of Whack-a-Mole, and the moles are getting better disguises.

Maybe the future is smaller, private communities with real human mods keeping watch. But for big subs, especially the front page, I think we’re already seeing the start of a slow shift. The conversations look the same, but they’re less and less our own.",6,4

The purposeless of this bot offends me for some reason - I'm sure I should hate the bots shilling T-Shirts, or destroying our democracy more. Goddamn though - Turning every positive/grateful interaction on reddit into a slightly negative and irritating experience makes the whole site worse with zero upside.

The global reports seem exceedingly limited in scope - Is there no path for dealing with valueless bot accounts like this? 4 years of mild annoyance is enough. ",10,14

Maybe the future is smaller, private communities with real human mods keeping watch. But for big subs, especially the front page, I think we’re already seeing the start of a slow shift. The conversations look the same, but they’re less and less our own.",6,4
2025-09-06,"$10,526 to $1,500,000 in 5 months thanks Google!","This account started the year with around $150,000 and I was playing NVDA. The stock tanked with everything else in April during liberation day and I was down to $526. I had to deposit another $10,000 to pick myself up and take revenge on the market. 

Luckily I caught Google on the dip to 148 and I had conviction that Google was going to the moon based on its P/E and great ai plays. 

I kept buying 5% otm calls 30 days out on red days and selling when the calls were in the money. Then I would open another position with more and more contracts every time. 

The last push was this weekend before Labor Day I held $450,000 cash and unloaded it on the dip Monday at 207 and bought $4.70 950 contracts of 220 strike calls for 10/17. Those calls were up $91,000 end of the day as you can see from my previous post. Today I sold at $16 per contract. ",24951,1260

2025-09-12,Oracle phenomena - “legacy” players pushing AI reaction?,"The recent case of Oracle got me thinking about the state of the markets, the AI hype and reality, and what it means for the future.

I’ve been pretty skeptical about Oracle’s surge, but they are about to recognize a lot of revenues. This market reaction is interesting because so far, the “big AI” bets were companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, Google, Meta, Broadcom, etc. Oracle, by contrast, has long been seen as more of a legacy play, focused on infrastructure for large enterprises.

What we’re seeing is that investors still go crazy for AI, especially when an established, “old guard” player gets involved. Is this an overreaction? Hard to say. Ideally, markets should value not just AI mentions and vision, but the actual value being unlocked. Maybe that’s exactly what’s being priced in here or maybe it’s an over- or underreaction, since we still don’t fully understand what AI will ultimately deliver.

Ofc there is lot more to Oracle than this but still im very curiousy

I’m curious to hear your take: are investors overestimating, underestimating, or pricing it just right? What do you think?:/

2025-09-17,Why today’s Nvidia–CoreWeave deal is a red flag for Oracle,"oracle pumped their stock saying ai demand is going to double. key word = *future*. they’re selling investors on what’s coming, not what’s actually happening today.

meanwhile, nvidia just cut a $6.3B deal to backstop coreweave’s unsold gpu capacity through 2032, and another $1.5B leaseback with lambda.

if demand is truly about to “double,” why would the biggest ai chip supplier on the planet be guaranteeing empty racks?

answer: current demand is uneven. frontier labs (openai, meta, etc) are burning compute, but enterprise adoption is way slower. workloads are lumpy. nvidia is hedging against slowdown *right now*.

so oracle’s forecast = hopium about tomorrow.  
nvidia’s actions = reality check today.

It’s 4x faster to load and render new worlds, so it takes just a few seconds.","Foundational Infrastructure: Meta Horizon Engine & Meta Horizon Studio
Meta Horizon Engine has been built from scratch and optimized to help bring the metaverse to life. It powers better graphics, faster performance, and more advanced worlds. Developers and creators will be able to use it to easily generate nearly infinite connected spaces with realistic physics and interactions.

We introduced Meta Horizon Studio, a new editor and hub for creator capabilities. It includes the generative AI tools we’ve added over the last year that let creators generate mesh, textures, TypeScript, audio, skyboxes, and more with simple text prompts, so they can make high-quality worlds in a fraction of the time. And soon, we’ll add an agentic AI assistant to stitch together different tools and make the creation process even faster and easier.

Using Horizon Engine, we built a new Immersive Home for VR. You can customize it by pinning apps in different spots. And you can jump straight from your home to a series of interconnected worlds. Thanks to Horizon Engine, it’s 4x faster to load and render new worlds, so it takes just a few seconds.

Horizon Engine also enables much greater concurrency, so more people can enjoy the same world at the same time. We can now support 100+ people in a single space — 5x more than our previous engine could handle. Now the vibes match the experience, whether you’re catching a concert with a huge crowd in our new Arena or meeting up with friends in Horizon Central to explore new worlds.",158,71
2025-09-18,Anyone watching meta connect right now? It is solid comedy gold,"Like yeah obviously i'm still interested in some of the stuff they are showing so i'm not just ripping it to pieces. But man so far it's been comedy gold.

Highlights:

* Meta ray-ban glasses 2.0. The thing nobody wanted and will probably be banned (i hope) because god knows creeps will use these for creepshots. Note that these are not the orion glasses. But apparently have a one-eye hud.
* The first video for the aformentioned product was pretty much a [Tim and Eric Cinco commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIsu557ecN4). The comedic timing of the first guy trying to have a conversation and the Ray-ban guy just going ""Oh hold on a a second"" .... pause.. ""HEY META CONVERSATION FOCUS MODE"".. ""yeah man go on"" was so god damn funny. Like who the hell in their right mind would want these glasses?
* Then we got a live demo where a chef tried to showcase how the live ai could scan the ingridients he had on the table in order to help him whip up a korean inspired steak sauce. Cue to the AI  assistant being convinced that he had already made half the sauce and should now start grating some pears (i don't know if he even had pears). The chef kind of tried salvaging it but the AI was still convinced that he had already made half the sauce. He pretty smoothly admitted it wasn't working and Mark was pretty quick to blame the wifi for not working (It wasn't the Wifi, the AI was just crapping out)
* On the ~~Orion~~ glasses (apparently they aren't orion glasses, rather some sort of one-eye hud thing) and neural link wristband, mark tries to do a videocall to Boz. This quickly devolved into absolute chaos as he missed the first call and the following 4 calls just wouldn't show up. But comically the ringtone kept beeping as he was talking.
* Mark now a little shook tried getting the AI to play a spotify song and you could almost see the tension releasing when it actually worked.
* James Cameron is now on the stage! Maybe he will announce another 10 avatar movies. I love the guy as a filmmaker and he is brilliant but he really seems to be stuck on the avatar idea. He really seems to have a kind of Tolkien obsession of fleshing out this world. It's inspiring. But i wish we got to see him make some stuff that isn't avatar before the guy retires.
* Now we're onto Mark and DJ Diplo doing like a running event outside of the convention. This is getting weird. But in a Tim and Eric way

It's a bit of a shame really that they are focusing so much on the meta AI (which nobody wants) and not the (orion) glasses and wristband, which are really cool tech.

They really are pushing these AI glasses (the ray bans) and man it's so damn stupid. But at least that failure showed that it was a genuine live demo, which is much better than a fake demo. So that's something.

Now we seem to be onto the ""neural interface"" wristband. Which seems like pretty exciting stuff.

And Mark is a pretty damn good presenter. He is charismatic and i'm surprisingly enjoying watching him talk quite a lot.

The live demo for the glasses is also kind of failing. But the wrist band seems incredibly intuitive to use.",367,231
2025-09-18,Mark Zuckerberg unveils $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses,"Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display.

The glasses, which costs $799, contain a small digital display that can be controlled via hand gestures through a wristband powered by neural technology, confirming a CNBC report in August. A promotional video of the new smart glasses appeared on Meta’s YouTube page on Monday but was later removed.

The new smart glasses are a bridge between the company’s audio-only Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and the experimental Orion augmented reality glasses that the company revealed at last year’s Connect event. Orion can overlay 3D visuals over a person’s real-world field of view with the help of a wireless computing puck, but the glasses are expensive to make and not yet available to consumers.

The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses come with the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that allows users to control the device using hand gestures.

“These are glasses with the classic style that you’d expect from Ray-Ban, but they’re the first AI glasses with a high resolution display and a fully weighted Meta neural band,” Zuckerberg said.

With the new glasses, people can do tasks like watch videos through the display or see and respond to text messages, Zuckerberg said. The display doesn’t block a person’s view, and it disappears when not being used, he said.

The glasses go on sale in the U.S. on Sept. 30.

The company on Wednesday also debuted the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses, intended for athletes who participate in high-intensity sports like snowboarding and mountain biking. The Oakley-branded glasses will cost $499 when they launch on Oct. 21, making it $100 more expensive than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses that went on sale in June.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses have a sportier look than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses thanks to a wraparound design that extends its colorful lenses around a person’s temples. Unlike the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, the new model contains a button on the underside of its frames so that athletes who wear helmets can more easily capture photos and videos.

The new sports-centric smart glasses have up to nine hours of battery life, can capture 3K video and contain speakers that are louder than their predecessors. The glasses can connect with Garmin-branded fitness watches to track certain stats like their heart rates using the Meta AI assistant. Preorders start today.

Meta also debuted the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the latest version of the company’s original smart glasses. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) costs $379, up from $299 for the version released in 2023. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) has double the battery life of the previous model, lasting 8 hours on a single charge, and a more powerful camera that can capture 3K Ultra HD video. The new glasses go on sale today.

Zuckerberg also announced Horizon TV, pitching it as a way to watch television shows, sporting events and movies using the company’s Quest VR headsets. Some of Meta’s partners who will be contributing content to the app include Disney and Universal Pictures, Zuckerberg said.

2025-09-21,Opening Discussion About RDDT,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.

2025-09-23,"My Meta Quest 3 randomly died after barely using it — warranty expired, support only offers to sell me another one","I bought my Quest 3 about a year ago and really liked it, even though I didn’t use it that often. A few weeks ago I stored it without use, and when I grabbed it again (excited to finally start giving it some real playtime) it just wouldn’t turn on. Completely dead.

After searching online, the only explanation I could find is that the **battery died from sitting unused and uncharged for a couple of weeks**. No one warns you about this beforehand (maybe I'm the only one who isn't aware of this feature), and honestly, for such an expensive device, I find it absurd that it can brick itself this way.

Now my warranty has just expired, and Meta support told me my only option is to buy a replacement through their Out of Warranty program for ""*only* $359.99"". That’s basically buying it all over again, despite the fact that I didn’t even get close to the amount of use I paid for. When I asked ‘Ron’ about any alternative solutions, like changing the battery, sending it for service, literally any option that wouldn’t just add to the growing pile of e-waste since the device wasn't damaged, I suddenly found myself speaking with ‘JayEm’ instead, d-move (she was nice, though).

I’ve tried every method I could find on forums, different chargers, button combos, holding power/volume, you name it. It’s just dead.

I’m posting this to tell my story and at least get this feeling off my chest, and partly as a warning for anyone considering buying a Quest 3: apparently if you leave it unused, you risk it turning into an expensive paperweight. And partly as a hail mary, if anyone has any trick I haven’t tried yet to bring it back to life, I’d be very grateful.

At this point I’m just really disillusioned. A customer shouldn’t have to worry about their device randomly dying from one day to the next, especially at this price point. After this experience, I doubt I’ll ever buy from Meta again.

2025-09-26,Looking for Beta testers and feedback for our virtual treadmill app - Gym Spatial (Meta Quest 2 and 3),"Hello Meta Quest lovers,  
We just released the Meta Quest version of our virtual treadmill app Gym Spatial, and we are looking for beta testers who would be kind enough to give us some feedback, to see if there are not any weird bugs that we missed, lags or other issues, and if everything is intuitive and easy to use.

For the context, it is a fitness app, that lets you run on a treadmill, use a stationary bike or rowing machine, while immersed in fun virtual environments. For now there are only a space station, a futuristic city, and a pirate's bay, but more are coming soon like Paris or some old school Nintendo 64 style environments... we will share some preview here.   
  
You can also give us some ideas if you want us to create a virtual environment in the future of course, we are open to ideas.

You don't need to connect to any real work out machine. How does it work? Very simple, the movement is a simple animation of the world that you can start and pause at will, and control the speed through a slider to match your treadmill or other equipment. It's very ""low tech"" in a way if you want :)

You can also ask your virtual trainers (a man or a woman), to show you how to perform some exercises, in the Gym virtual environment (just a luxurious gym by the sea). Real full workout sessions coming soon.

If you are interested in helping us, and discovering the app for free of course, tell me here in comment (or in a private message), and I will send you a private key to get the app for free.

We created only 20 keys for now, so only the first 20 people who will contact me will get a key. But of course if many of you are super interested, maybe we can release a bit more we will see.

2025-09-26,"SPT Sprout Social - No one talks about it, and i dont know why","Here’s everything you need to know about SPT - Sprout Social. If you still believe the company is not undervalued after reading this, I can’t help you.

1. In the era of AI, data plays a crucial role. Sprout Social connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this amount of data.

2. Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social’s strategic significance.

3. Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout’s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.


Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:

- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It’s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.


Risks:
- „But there is an investigation“. That’s for wrongdoing. I think there were 200 cases like this last year. Let’s say they have to pay $25 million - $23 million will be paid by D&O, and Sprout will pay $2 million. Thats nothing.

- „I make more profit than they do“. Value doesn’t necessarily equate to profit. Over the past three years, they’ve acquired three companies. The product has received new features and a significant amount of AI integration. Growth is more crucial than profit, as profit will naturally follow. Sprinklr became profitable too early, resulting in revenue growth of about 6%, but the company is currently struggling. Sprout, on the other hand, has experienced double-digit revenue growth and is poised for even greater success as it shifts towards serving upmarket and larger customers, like Honda and NASCAR. Trust me, profits will follow.

- „High SBC“. Yes, this is true, and I don’t like it either. As far as I know, in 2023, they offered their employees SBC. However, at least SBC didn’t increase last year and instead remained flat. Nevertheless, SBC is high, and I don’t like it either. Without it, they would already be profitable. What’s important to me is that they are operational profitable, even though they are not GAAP-based. GAAP-based profit will follow.",0,16

2025-09-28,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

2025-09-29,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!
