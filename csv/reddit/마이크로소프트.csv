2024-10-19,Microsoft Job Application Status,"Hi all,

I tried to find a similar post on reddit but no luck so I'm making my own. I recently applied to a job at Microsoft. I checked the ""Action Center"" today and I had a notifcation saying my application was no longer being considered. I clicked to view more details and it brings me to an empty ""inactive"" folder. The application is currently still sat in submitted and in review. Has anyone else experienced this before? I'm just trying to figure out if I should move on or not. 

Any information would be greatly appreciated. 

  
Thank you ",0,22
2024-10-20,A new grad's desperate need for advice to prepare for the Microsoft IC2 SDE interview,"Hey guys, I am a new grad master's in CS student, who graduated in June 2024.   
  
However, I have been hunting for an SDE job for at least a year. So, I have applied to at least 1500 jobs in the past year, and several times to Microsft. Fortunately, this Wednesday I received an OA from a recruiter for a Microsoft IC2 role in the US. I also passed the OA on the same day. So, I might have final rounds in probably 10 days time. And, I really don't want to miss this opportunity, not just because I have been on the job hunt for 1 year, but also because it is MICROSOFT and I know this job can completely change my career trajectory.

For a little background, I have been solving DSA problems on leetcode for a year now, but more consistently for the past 3 months. I am familiar with most patterns and data structures, but still I am not expert level, I can only solve the not-so-complex medium questions. For statistics I have solved 454 problems on LC as of today, I have completed Grind 75, Grind 169 and Neetcode 75 lists and a few more problems.

However, I don't know much regarding System design especially HLD, and I only know the common design patterns in LLD. 

So, I am seeking out for advice from anyone who might shed some light on how should I prepare in this 10 days to maximize my chances of cracking the interview. I have heard the interview loop would consist of 3 or 4 45-minute interviews.

I also have some specific questions and if you can answer these it would be great.

1. Does grinding the most frequent Microsoft-tagged problems on Leetcode help? Can I only do that, and pray that they might ask me those? Also are there any fav data structures or algos for MSFT?

2. Do they ask System design problems for IC2 candidates, considering they are entry-level, and if so would they be LLD or HLD?

3. How difficult are the behavioral questions in Microsoft's interviews, are they like notoriously tough Amazon kinda LP questions are more generic ones that can be found on the internet?

Sorry for the long question, I am kind of nervous and I wrote everything that was on my mind for the past few days. Any advice would help. Hoping this post gets some attention from the community 🙏 Thank you in advance guys!!",7,14

2024-10-30,Prediction: Apple is grossly priced compared to Microsoft,"Congrats to those that followed my last Costco post. I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. 

**Apple**

* Market cap: 3.6T
* Current P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6
* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits
* Earnings growth: Low double digits
* Net Margin: 25%

 **Microsoft**

* Market cap: 3.2T
* Microsoft P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8
* Historical revenue growth: 15%
* Earnings growth: 15-20%
* Net margin: 35%

Last week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a ""potential supercycle"" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.

In my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.

To me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.

Here’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!

Tl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft

P.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is.

2024-10-30,MSFT Pre-Earnings Analysis: AI Arms Race and Channel Check - AI Number May Show Double Digit Growth in Q1 2025 - Monster Quarter Growth,"This might be one of Microsoft's most influential quarters in quite some time. The main argument for my thesis is OpenAI and recent AI model upgrades from in the form of GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-o1, and GPT-o1-mini. As well, I don't know if anyone noticed their Uranium portfolio's going through the roof but if not check out SMR, OKLO and others to see more. AI needs so much power that they are opening up defunct nuclear power plants on 3-mile island in Pennsylvania for new energy sources.

What most media types don't have a window into, mostly I assume this because they keep saying the same silly thing over and over again, is that enterprise is using AI. AI is not going to come in the form of a ""killer app"". The killer app is ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral. Those are the killer apps but those are also not important things in the AI arms race. AI in and of in itself is the killer app. The reason for this is that it commoditized intelligence in the form of tokens that can be literally bought and sold through the cloud.

When certain media types keep railing on the notion that ""who's making money with this"" they are missing the reality in that people are making money with this each and every day. The enterprise is creating applications that are simply not understood by everyday people or analysts because there not the ""killer apps"" that people think of which represents mostly something popular that teenagers and young adults are into. Is Venmo a killer app? Is Facebook a killer apps still? I don't know maybe I'm just not with the times. What i do know is that is that AI is so large and so democratized that the use cases, while not killer, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise setting.

This is the fast and steady drum beat of GAI increasingly taking over all human cognitive tasks.  It won't happen overnight but it is happening. I think what is happening with the media is that they can't put a metric to it so I will attempt to.

AI adoption and penetration into everyday processes and tasks for enterprise is probably at 0.6%-1%. If you include the backlog of potential AI penetration it is probably 2 - 5% of all enterprise tasks and processes. The immediate 1 - 2 year outlook of AI penetration is probably 1 - 3% with a backlog of 6-9%. To be clear, I am not considering productivity gains because who the hell cares about any of that.  I am specifically speaking about cold hard ROI of implementing an AI automation system and having that AI do the work that was once a human task now offloading to an AI automation task.

I don't know how you feel about the above numbers but in my interpretation it is incredibly slow but growth can be incredibly exponential in relatively a short amount of time. The reason, I've written about this many times before, is because the data is not ready, the talent is not there to reconstruct and rebuild what needs to be in place to make efficient data process that are specific to AI, and many many other factors.

This is why consulting through the likes of Accenture, Palantir, IBM and others will be very important in the coming years. It's my opinion that companies now matter how large or small won't be able to put in the right processes without proven practices that will foster from consultancy groups rather than at home grown talent. However, there will be clues of how well the progress is going. An AI channel check if you will.

**AI Channel Check through Microsoft Azure:**

Microsoft provides this channel check for us. Alphabet just completed their channel check and the news on AI was good. Continued spending for all things AI and healthy numbers in their core businesses to justify the continued spend. I look for Microsoft to report much in the same way in terms of AI CapEx/Spend.

2 quarters ago Microsoft started reporting the AI portion of their Azure Cloud revenues. 2 quarters ago it was 6%, and the previous quarter it rose to 7%. For their earnings report tomorrow the AI revenue should be in the 10-12% range. In my opinion 8% is not going to cut it. 1% quarterly gain seems slow. The number in aggregate should be 2%+ quarter to quarter growth. In this way, 1% isn't going to cut it for Wall Street. Perhaps we do see 8%-9% next quarter and that wouldn't be a horrible thing but if Microsoft wants to blow the doors off of earnings and reestablish a healthy growth pattern it is of my opinion that number of percent AI revenue shares needs a meaningful bps up.

I believe that in this earnings there will be that meaningful click upwards of AI percentage growth for Microsoft in the 10%+ range. 11% would be a bust out surprise and 12% would be significantly positive. So where is this possible 3% rise in AI revenue growth coming from? Look no further than GPT-4o.

**GPT-4o and the AI Number**

Gpt-4o was initially released on May 13, 2024. For reference, Microsoft's last quarter was, Q4 2024, ended on June 30, 2024, with earnings reported on July 30, 2024. **AI number 7%**. There was no way for GPT-4o to significantly penetrate into their earnings with only roughly 30 days of usage. If you take into account the iterations of 4o itself the model initially was met with skepticism (compared to GPT-4-Turbo) and apprehension until subsequent versions of 4o were released. All-in-all, there is no way GPT-4o was going to be in the previous quarters (Q4) earnings report.

However, what's even more interesting is the increase in quota and throughput of GPT-4 to GPT-4o. This is where I believe the AI number from Microsoft will materially increase. Let's take a look.

First, let's start with **GPT-4-Turbo** which was released November 6, 2023.

**Git Commit** [e477326](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/e4773268e4e732aefff0f4e3e448568dd4ed998a/articles/ai-services/openai/concepts/models.md):

Commit **e477326** was dated to Nov 22, 2023. A preview was available, 1106, as of Nov 17, 2023. Using this as a ground truth you can see that the token limit is 134k per minute with a max of 2.7 K requests per minute. this and surely prior to this was hell on enterprises to do any meaningful work with the models. It was great for experimenting and getting started but not for meaningful production work.

**GPT-4o** was released on May 13, 2024.

**Git Commit** [431bb24](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/431bb24aadae464afbeb46a522cf613dc9418025/articles/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits.md):

https://preview.redd.it/wyyz8h6sosxd1.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=d91756d0d138410a1bbc5e007bccb147828aac74

Commit **431bb24** was dated to May 20, 2024. As you can see from previous GPT-4 capacity limitations GPT-4o introduced a massive improvement for quota limit TPM and requests per minute RPM. This is a significant release for enterprise customers as they can now begin to plan, develop, and execute AI software stacks into production environments. 60 K RPM's is a 22X upgrade towards production throughput.

**Git Commit** [30084ae](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/30084aee1f0f82335490af8b4b7bd8912cc02af0/articles/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits.md):

https://preview.redd.it/0wa2vvvarsxd1.png?width=1026&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2126f42a5a765364f75e5eace23c250d2e6fb7c

Commit **30084ae** was dated July 24, 2024. In this update the quota TPM was raised from 10M to 30M tokens per minute.

[**Current Quota Limits**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits):

https://preview.redd.it/l2ah831essxd1.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f59ee5eb421e81d5eb40afb16147f11b3b0c293

In the current quota limits there is a 180 K RPM increase from 60 K. At this point and earlier in the quarter OpenAI's GPT-4o models became capacity unlocked. There is nothing you cannot do or plan for in terms of AI model integrations, TPM's, or RPM throughput. At this moment, intelligence is untethered from any api constraints. What you can imagine building in terms of AI and LLMs and the delivery of those products and services can be fully realized without constraint.

If you go from the beginning analysis of GPT-4-Turbo until today there is a **223X tokens per minute (TPM) increase and a 66.66X request per minute (RPM) increase.**

This is a massive throughput gain that cannot be expressed enough of how significant this is in terms of AI advancements regarding enterprise adoption.

This is why I believe the AI Number finally breaks the double digits in this quarter of 10%+. Ever since the last quarter ended, June 30, 2024, there has been a steady stream of AI model improvements and api throughput improvements that are significant in scope. If you couple this with Google's continued AI spend and quality quarter, AI hardware channel checks that verify the AI hardware spend, and a github repo commit history that shows nothing but blazing improvements for Microsoft Azure intelligence; It could not be more clear to me that Microsoft is executing on all levels and should deliver a potentially monster quarter.

Not that it needs it but here is the plug for NVDA as well. All of those github commits and throughput improvements are directly related to Microsoft bringing data centers online all over the world.

This is insane! I don't have to tell you the git commits for this graph are absolutely bonkers too.

2024-11-01,Limited Conditional access on break glass account,"I have a client who is……let’s say extremely risk averse.

They do not have an office presence so their break glass account will be purely remote.

I recommended the typical setup I do for remote which is a physical Fido2 device, which they balked at.  I then offered an account which is a CA exempt break glass account with global admin and the password broken into two pieces, each stored with a senior executive.  Which is largely aligned with msft best practice.

They don’t feel this is “enough” and want me to restrict the account via conditionals to only be available to specific devices….which is kind of counterintuitive to the purpose of the account.  

I had thought of maybe suggesting using a an ip policy to restrict login to only company egress ranges, but even that seemed unwise…what if their network goes down and they need to get into azure?

Before I start to cook up some nonsensical solution (or more likely just say maybe I’m not the right person for you) - has anyone experienced this level of pushback on what is basically established best practice?  And how did you keep the client happy?",10,14

2024-11-19,Palantir $PLTR is extremely overpriced.,"**1. Valuation Metrics Are Sky-High**  
Palantir currently trades at a Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of approximately 53.13, significantly higher than industry peers.

[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/PLTR) Even for a growth company, this level of valuation is extreme and implies future growth rates that may be unattainable.



**2. Revenue Growth Isn’t Scaling as Expected**  
While Palantir’s revenue growth has been solid, it’s showing signs of deceleration:

* FY 2022: 24% year-over-year growth
* FY 2023 (projected): 18% year-over-year growth

This deceleration doesn’t justify its premium valuation. Additionally, the company remains heavily reliant on government contracts, which are often lumpy and unpredictable.

**3. Profitability Is Still Questionable**  
Despite boasting about achieving GAAP profitability recently, Palantir has heavily relied on stock-based compensation (SBC). In fact, SBC accounted for approximately 30% of their operating expenses last quarter, which dilutes shareholder value and raises questions about true profitability.

**4. AI Hype Is Inflating the Bubble**  
The market has been overly optimistic about Palantir’s AI capabilities. While their AI Platform (AIP) sounds promising, actual adoption metrics and revenue contribution from AIP remain vague. It’s easy to talk AI; it’s harder to monetize it sustainably.

**5. Insider Selling Signals Lack of Confidence**  
Executives have been offloading shares at a significant rate. For instance, Chairman Peter Thiel sold a substantial portion of his holdings recently.

[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-lead-sell-palantir-stock-223000919.html)If the leadership team doesn’t see long-term upside at these prices, why should we?



**6. Competitive Pressure Is Mounting**  
Palantir operates in a crowded space with competitors like Snowflake ($SNOW), Databricks, and Microsoft ($MSFT) offering similar or better solutions. Palantir’s dependence on government clients limits its commercial reach in comparison.

**TL;DR:**  
Palantir is an interesting company with solid tech, but the stock price is disconnected from fundamentals. High valuations, slowing growth, heavy SBC, and reliance on government contracts make $PLTR a risky bet at current levels. AI hype has driven the price into bubble territory, and insiders don’t seem confident in its future.

What do you think? Is $PLTR worth its valuation, or are we seeing another overhyped tech bubble? Let’s discuss! 👇

* FY 2022: 24% year-over-year growth
* FY 2023 (projected): 18% year-over-year growth

This deceleration doesn’t justify its premium valuation. Additionally, the company remains heavily reliant on government contracts, which are often lumpy and unpredictable.

**3. Profitability Is Still Questionable**  
Despite boasting about achieving GAAP profitability recently, Palantir has heavily relied on stock-based compensation (SBC). In fact, SBC accounted for approximately 30% of their operating expenses last quarter, which dilutes shareholder value and raises questions about true profitability.

**4. AI Hype Is Inflating the Bubble**  
The market has been overly optimistic about Palantir’s AI capabilities. While their AI Platform (AIP) sounds promising, actual adoption metrics and revenue contribution from AIP remain vague. It’s easy to talk AI; it’s harder to monetize it sustainably.

**5. Insider Selling Signals Lack of Confidence**  
Executives have been offloading shares at a significant rate. For instance, Chairman Peter Thiel sold a substantial portion of his holdings recently.

**6. Competitive Pressure Is Mounting**  
Palantir operates in a crowded space with competitors like Snowflake ($SNOW), Databricks, and Microsoft ($MSFT) offering similar or better solutions. Palantir’s dependence on government clients limits its commercial reach in comparison.

**TL;DR:**  
Palantir is an interesting company with solid tech, but the stock price is disconnected from fundamentals. High valuations, slowing growth, heavy SBC, and reliance on government contracts make $PLTR a risky bet at current levels. AI hype has driven the price into bubble territory, and insiders don’t seem confident in its future.

In a recent Wall Street survey, Google Cloud topped Microsoft (MSFT.O) and OpenAI as the “most strategic” AI vendor.



Budget changes. As the holiday season approaches, technology procurement leaders at major enterprises are busy prioritizing their technology spending plans for 2025. These budget adjustments could signal potential changes in market share and spending direction.



While OpenAI and Microsoft are getting a lot of attention in the AI space, a new CIO (chief information officer) survey shows that Alphabet (GOOGL.O) is rapidly coming into its own in the enterprise AI spending race.



Piper Sandler's 2025 CIO Survey, which was released over the weekend, interviewed 81 CIOs about their budget priorities for different vendors and technology areas.



“The tech industry will be dynamic in 2025,” Piper Sandler's analyst team writes, ”with generative AI transitioning from the testing/planning phase to implementation and driving growth in cloud spending.”



Analysts noted that 87 percent of CIOs expect their IT budgets to increase in 2025, the highest percentage since the survey began in 2020.



The popularity of Google Cloud increased significantly compared to the previous two surveys. In the “most strategic” AI vendor category, Google Cloud received 27 percent support, up from 15 percent six months ago. Meanwhile, Microsoft, the former leader, saw its support drop from 33% to 24%.



Google Cloud also topped the ranking of AI infrastructure providers. When asked which cloud company they plan to test or implement AI projects with next year, 50 percent of respondents chose Google Cloud.



Overall, this is good news for the major cloud infrastructure providers.The uptick in interest in AI applications and projects has led to higher spending intentions than six months ago for all providers, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).



The trend has been equally favorable to the parent companies of these cloud companies - Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet and Oracle (ORCL.N).



It's also a big plus for NVIDIA (NVDA.O), according to Harsh Kumar, a semiconductor analyst at Piper.



All cloud companies are big customers of NVIDIA's AI chips. NVIDIA holds more than 70 percent of the AI GPU (graphics processing unit) market, according to analysts.Kumar expects the AI chip market to exceed $500 billion by 2028.



If CIOs' budget plans come to fruition, 2025 will be a major growth year for AI. Investors are already picking up on the trend, with Alphabet's shares having risen nearly 15 percent this month.

Personally, I think the short-term risk is high and the better strategy in the long run is to buy low

2024-12-16,2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

# Realized (sold) in 2024

* **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):** \-18.69% (\*)
* **Amazon (AMZN):** \+97.41%
* **Alphabet/Google (GOOGL):** \+75.05%
* **Apple (AAPL):** \+8.77% (\*)

* **Unity (U):** \-8.73%

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

>\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~24% and \~16%.",833,182

2024-12-30,Seeking advice on getting a technical program mgr role at MSFT,"Hello, I'm looking for a new job. I'm seeking advice on applying and landing a job at Microsoft as a Technical Program Manager. The two questions I have:

\- what to highlight on the resume to get the attention of the people reviewing resumes (e.g., the person that screens the resume, hiring manager) to get that call for an interview?  What I've done is reviewed a few MSFT TPM postings, reviewed my work experience, and did my best to align my work experience to what MSFT is seeking in the posting.  E.g., highlighting leading cross-functional teams, how to respond to challenges, and other things).

\- interview prep - any recommendations on how to prepare for an interview of a TPM at MSFT? I will browse  reddit and glassdoor to see what people are saying. While I feel my communication is great, I tend to get a bit nervous in interviews so I want to practice to gain more confidence. 

my background: I'm currently working as an IT Project Manager (and have been an Technical/IT Project manager on Infrastructure, Data analytics, and Security projects for the last seven years - also, I've spent some time leading programs). Prior to being an Project Manager, I was a Group Leader, System Engineer, and C# Developer. I've worked most of my career in software / technology companies. I've spoken with two TPMs at different technology companies to learn about the role and background people come from - I feel my prior experience makes me a great fit as a TPM (I just need to sell it! :) )

I want to start my job search on MSFT because I've always admired the company for its innovations and respect in the industry. I will apply to other companies, but my dream job would be MSFT and I figure the prep work I need to do for MSFT will serve me well for opportunities at other companies.

Thank you everyone!

2025-01-09,Microsoft confirms performance-based job cuts across departments,"Microsoft is cutting a small percentage of jobs across departments, based on performance, the company confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday.

“At Microsoft we focus on high-performance talent,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in an email to CNBC on Wednesday. “We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action.”

Business Insider reported on the plans late Tuesday.

The job cuts will affect less than 1% of employees, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named in order to discuss private information.

Microsoft had 228,000 employees at the end of June. While the company’s net income margin of nearly 38% is close to its highest since the early 2000s, Microsoft’s stock underperformed its peers last year, rising 12% while the Nasdaq gained 29%.

Microsoft’s latest cuts are slim compared to recent downsizing efforts.

In early 2023, the company laid off 10,000 employees and consolidated leases. In January 2024, three months after completing the $75.4 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition, Microsoft’s gaming unit shed 1,900 jobs to reduce overlap.

As 2025 begins, Microsoft faces a more tenuous relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, which the company has backed to the tune of over $13 billion. The partnership helped propel Microsoft’s market cap past $3 trillion last year.

Over the summer, Microsoft added OpenAI to its list of competitors. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella used the phrase “cooperation tension” while discussing the relationship with investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley on a podcast released last month.

Meanwhile, the Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant, which draws on OpenAI technology, has yet to become pervasive in business. Analysts at UBS said in a note last month that they came away from Microsoft’s Ignite conference with the impression that Copilot rollouts “have been a bit slow/underwhelming.”

Microsoft is still touting its growth opportunities. Finance chief Amy Hood said in October that revenue growth from Microsoft’s Azure cloud will speed up in the first half of this year because of greater AI infrastructure capacity.

2025-01-14,China Discusses Sale of TikTok US to Musk as One Possible Option,"Bloomberg: Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.

Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent ByteDance Ltd., the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on Jan. 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trump’s administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.

A potential high-profile deal with one of Trump’s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump’s re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.

Under one scenario that’s been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk’s X — the former Twitter — would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X’s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.

Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It’s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It’s also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.

Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk posted in April that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. “In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,” he wrote on X. “Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.”

ByteDance and TikTok representatives didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China’s Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok’s future, also didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok’s fate may no longer be in ByteDance’s sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.

The Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company’s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing’s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok’s valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.

TikTok’s US operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That’s a substantial sum even for the world’s richest person. It’s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.

Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his Tesla Inc. business, the person added.

ByteDance’s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok’s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution’s First Amendment.

A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban — which takes effect Jan. 19 — so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to “save” the app and there’s been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.

On a practical level, spinning off TikTok’s US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be “extraordinarily difficult.”

It’s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O’Leary has said he discussed with Trump. In the past, Microsoft Corp. had sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company.

One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app — with different branding — to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It’s not clear how effective such a move would be.

One person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.

Musk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world’s richest person with businesses that straddle the world’s two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company’s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.

While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration’s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.

**Thoughts:** Obviously this type of news has the ability to move TSLA/META/social networks. We've seen TSLA make moves from political news, SpaceX news, Twitter news, and TSLA trades as a proxy to whatever Elon Musk is doing at the time even if it's not directly applicable to TSLA as a company. 

Very low probability of it happening but interesting to brainstorm trading ideas.

2025-01-30,Microsoft shares slip on light quarterly Azure growth,"Microsoft shares fell 5% in extended trading on Wednesday after the software company issued fiscal second quarter results that included lighter growth in Azure cloud computing services than expected.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG estimates:

Earnings per share: $3.23 vs. $3.11 expected
Revenue: $69.63 billion vs. $68.78 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue grew 12% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Dec. 31, according to a statement.

2025-01-31,Visa transition Delays with MSFT - Seeking Advice,"I received an offer from Microsoft two months ago, but my TN visa transition is still unclear. On top of that, the I-129 petition went to an RFE(Request for evidence), which is surprising since my job and education are perfectly aligned, and I’ve previously obtained TN visas without issues. According to the lawyers, they still haven’t received the RFE details, even though it was issued nine days ago.

I asked them to use a backup option and allow me to apply directly at the port of entry instead, but they have not accepted yet. Things have become very complicated, and I feel incredibly nervous and stressed. I have already notified my current employer about my last day, making the situation even more difficult. My manager at MSFT urgently needs me to start, but this is entirely out of my control.

Has anyone had a similar experience with Microsoft? Is it possible to insist they allow me to apply directly at the port of entry instead of waiting several more weeks for the USCIS decision?

  
UPDATE: They just informed me that the RFE is straightforward and not complicated, and they are able to submit a response to USCIS soon. ",8,11

2025-02-04,If I Had Only Knew.. Before Joining MSFT,"Let me first say Microsoft is a great company. But before accepting the offer there are some things I wish I did a better job of before saying I accept.

* Researched the role a lot more on sites like Reddit and Glassdoor - Titles can be misleading.
* Knew the level I was coming in at - Not just the number and salary but where you are on the ladder and compare it to where you are now. Be comfortable if you do decide to jump because it might be a while before you move up. Just to note, there are ""firewalls"" between certain levels like 62-63. The criteria to get through the firewalls are not just your average ""I do a good job so promote me."" So you might want to fight that battle before joining to make sure you come in where you should be based on your experience. A lot of people come in under where they were previously. I've seen VPs come in at Sr. level. Some people just say if the pay is equivalent or better then I'm good, like I did. Microsoft pays more than average and I wouldn't do that again.
* Knew that what org you come into matters - Don't just think because you are in the building it's easy to change rooms. There are internal biases between rooms and even teams.
* (As you probably can tell by the recent layoffs) Knew performance matters - I knew this. Duh. Like everywhere performance matters. BUT to others, if you are not a self motivated individual then don't waste your time. Just to note, it's stressful working here. So if you don't do stress well then stay where you are at.

2025-02-26,A closer look at Microsoft news – buy the AI dip?,"As is usual before NVDA earnings, FUD is being spread about the ‘AI trade.’ I find this situation again reminiscent of the DeepSeek panic which NVDA and other AI plays quickly rebounded from in about a week (see my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1icdu1d/deepseek_training_cost_the_95_mil_difference/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) highlighting the blatant misunderstanding of renting GPUs for $5.6m vs. total cost of ownership for AI infrastructure in $100s of billions).

**The FUD: ‘data center oversupply’**

Headlines have been coming out that Microsoft walking away from a “couple hundred MWs” of datacenter leases (note, this would likely represent <5% of their overall estimated 5 GW installed capacity). Analysts are also insinuating this means there is a larger ‘oversupply’ and therefore AI capital expenditures will be slowing down.

[The Register - Microsoft's drawback on datacenter investment may signal AI demand concerns](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj8jtzHg9-LAxXol-4BHfCRJ4cQxfQBKAB6BAgPEAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.com%2F2025%2F02%2F24%2Fdoes_microsoft_pull_back_on%2F&usg=AOvVaw3nXfbntonLATxN5KnPWAzG&opi=89978449)

*“TD Investment bank claims software giant ditched 'at least' 5 land parcels due to potential 'oversupply'”*

 

**The Critique: Dip Buying Opp?**

First off, it is not clear if these MSFT leases are for high-performance compute (GPUs for AI workloads) or traditional non-AI cloud (for things like storage, where demand has been waning). For the sake of argument, let’s assume this was for AI compute.

**Point 1** \- Overall, Microsoft is not slowing down. After the TD report on Friday, Microsoft [reiterated they are not cutting their $80bil capital spending plan for this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-reiterates-plan-to-invest-80-billion-in-ai-.html). So, as they are walking away from a couple hundred MWs of leased capacity, meanwhile they will be building several GWs.

**Point 2** \- In Q4, Microsoft missed cloud revenue targets. On the earnings call, CFO Amy hood noted shortfalls in Q4 performance was due to supply constraints, and the larger capex spend is expected to drive stronger Azure growth. In other words, the revenue miss was a *capacity problem*, not a *demand problem*. So why slow down now? Doesn’t add up.

**Point 3** – Open AI is adding more compute capacity with other partners (Oracle and Softbank). This would represent a ***shift*** in capital spending from Microsoft to others, i.e. this does not indicate an oversupply.

[Microsoft and OpenAI evolve partnership to drive the next phase of AI - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/)

“Microsoft has **approved OpenAI’s ability to build additional capacity**, primarily for research and training of models.”

[OpenAI Stargate Joint Venture Demystified | Microsoft Sore Loser, Does Softbank Have The Capital?, Texas GigaCampus, Winners & Losers – SemiAnalysis](https://semianalysis.com/2025/01/23/openai-stargate-joint-venture-demystified/#microsoft-is-the-biggest-loser)

“**Microsoft is largely left on the sidelines as OpenAI utilizes another infrastructure partner.** As Satya Nadella [stated](https://x.com/ns123abc/status/1882085592135237737?s=19), “all I know is, I’m good for my $80B.” Microsoft’s recent [blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/) stated the facts of the partnership and how Microsoft has a ROFR, but the reality is this is incrementally negative for Microsoft long-term since they were **afraid to take on the risk of this investment.** “

“**Microsoft is shifting some of the capital intensity of its AI initiatives on to Oracle**, but we don’t think this short-term benefit outweighs the long-run potential harm of losing the revenue and control over OpenAI.”

**AI continues advancements:**

Anthropic’s [Claude 3.7](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-7-sonnet-the-first-hybrid-reasoning-model-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/) was released Monday and is quickly approaching professional human-level coding abilities (70% on SWE bench, which measures agentic coding ability vs. 80% avg. score for a human professional). Open AI’s ChatGPT 4.5 is rumored to be released in the coming weeks as well. These are/will be tangible results in the advancement of these models towards agentic use with addressable markets in the trillions (think remote ‘drop-in’ AI coworker). Further, continued investment in U.S. AI infrastructure will be of paramount importance to national security (maintaining AI supremacy over China).  

**TLDR:** I see this as a dip buying opportunity on AI names & energy. Overreaction from MSFT news. (NVDA, TSM, VRT\*\*, AVGO, MRVL, ANET, CIEN, NBIS, APLD, VST, OKLO, ET, KMI)

\*\*See UBS 11:27 AM ET, 02/25/2025 note on Vertiv: “Our conclusion is the recent sell-off is way overdone, as it implies >30% reduction in data center capacity growth vs. what was priced in just 30 days ago.""

First off, it is not clear if these MSFT leases are for high-performance compute (GPUs for AI workloads) or traditional non-AI cloud (for things like storage, where demand has been waning). For the sake of argument, let’s assume this was for AI compute.

**Point 1** \- Overall, Microsoft is not slowing down. After the TD report on Friday, Microsoft [reiterated they are not cutting their $80bil capital spending plan for this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-reiterates-plan-to-invest-80-billion-in-ai-.html). So, as they are walking away from a couple hundred MWs of leased capacity, meanwhile they will be building several GWs.

**Point 2** \- In Q4, Microsoft missed cloud revenue targets. On the earnings call, CFO Amy hood noted shortfalls in Q4 performance was due to supply constraints, and the larger capex spend is expected to drive stronger Azure growth. In other words, the revenue miss was a *capacity problem*, not a *demand problem*. So why slow down now? Doesn’t add up.

**Point 3** – Open AI is adding more compute capacity with other partners (Oracle and Softbank). This would represent a ***shift*** in capital spending from Microsoft to others, i.e. this does not indicate an oversupply.

[Microsoft and OpenAI evolve partnership to drive the next phase of AI - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/)

“Microsoft has **approved OpenAI’s ability to build additional capacity**, primarily for research and training of models.”

[OpenAI Stargate Joint Venture Demystified | Microsoft Sore Loser, Does Softbank Have The Capital?, Texas GigaCampus, Winners & Losers – SemiAnalysis](https://semianalysis.com/2025/01/23/openai-stargate-joint-venture-demystified/#microsoft-is-the-biggest-loser)

“**Microsoft is largely left on the sidelines as OpenAI utilizes another infrastructure partner.** As Satya Nadella [stated](https://x.com/ns123abc/status/1882085592135237737?s=19), “all I know is, I’m good for my $80B.” Microsoft’s recent [blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/) stated the facts of the partnership and how Microsoft has a ROFR, but the reality is this is incrementally negative for Microsoft long-term since they were **afraid to take on the risk of this investment.** “

“**Microsoft is shifting some of the capital intensity of its AI initiatives on to Oracle**, but we don’t think this short-term benefit outweighs the long-run potential harm of losing the revenue and control over OpenAI.”

**AI continues advancements:**

Anthropic’s [Claude 3.7](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-7-sonnet-the-first-hybrid-reasoning-model-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/) was released Monday and is quickly approaching professional human-level coding abilities (70% on SWE bench, which measures agentic coding ability vs. 80% avg. score for a human professional). Open AI’s ChatGPT 4.5 is rumored to be released in the coming weeks as well. These are/will be tangible results in the advancement of these models towards agentic use with addressable markets in the trillions (think remote ‘drop-in’ AI coworker). Further, continued investment in U.S. AI infrastructure will be of paramount importance to national security (maintaining AI supremacy over China).  

**TLDR:** I see this as a dip buying opportunity on AI names & energy. Overreaction from MSFT news. (NVDA, TSM, VRT\*\*, AVGO, MRVL, ANET, CIEN, NBIS, APLD, VST, OKLO, ET, KMI)

\*\*See UBS 11:27 AM ET, 02/25/2025 note on Vertiv: “Our conclusion is the recent sell-off is way overdone, as it implies >30% reduction in data center capacity growth vs. what was priced in just 30 days ago.""

2025-02-28,Skype to Shut 14 Years After Microsoft’s $8.5 Billion Purchase,">Microsoft Corp. is signaling the end of the line for Skype, the iconic internet calling and chat service it bought almost 14 years ago.

>Once a byword for digital calls that bypassed long-distance charges, Skype was surpassed in recent years by smartphone-native communication apps and Zoom video calls. When Microsoft tried to stretch the Skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to Slack Technologies Inc.

>Microsoft’s response was to start from scratch and build Teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May.

>“I’ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools.

>Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users.

>Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by eBay Inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when Steve Ballmer came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype’s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age.

>It didn’t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn’t. Microsoft’s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared Skype, which found itself in the Office division and under orders to build tools geared toward a workplace audience as well as a consumer one.

>By the time Slack arrived on the scene, Skype users were complaining that elements of the core experience had started to break down. They cited missed or phantom calls and failures to sync information on different devices. The company worked to improve the service’s reliability, but some loyal users were put off by frequent redesigns, including a short-lived effort to fashion Skype in the mold of Snapchat.

>Microsoft, which also saw its acquisition of Nokia Oyj’s mobile phone business end in failure, is far from alone in encountering rejection by a fickle consumer market. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has cycled through several iterations and brands for its online communications tools, which are today known as Chat and Meet. And this month, Amazon.com Inc. said it would be winding down Chime, the video and voice calling service it tried with little success to sell to corporate clients.

>The Windows maker is shuttering Skype to focus on developing new features for Teams, including artificial intelligence tools, Teper said. The company is working to infuse AI into its product suite, while keeping a lid on spending that isn’t part of that effort. It’s reassigning staff that had worked on Skype to other areas of the business and will not lay anyone off, Teper added.

>At one point, Skype played host to one of Microsoft’s biggest AI demonstrations: a real-time translator. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had nudged researchers to bring the product to market as quickly as possible and heralded it as “magical” in a 2014 demonstration early on in his tenure.

>Teams is “going well and this is a step to double down on it,” Teper said, adding that Microsoft wanted to keep Skype running until it was confident that the Teams version for individual users was fully ready. “It’s the most successful product in its category by far,” he said.



Link: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/microsoft-msft-to-shut-down-skype-as-zoom-teams-dominate-video-calls](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/microsoft-msft-to-shut-down-skype-as-zoom-teams-dominate-video-calls)

**My Take:** Thank god. ZM might stand to be a major benefactor from this. MSFT already has Teams that serves as a workplace call tool, but Skype has tried to expand into the workplace forum space (like Slack) and has failed. MSFT is citing this more as a doubling-down on Teams rather than admitting ZM has eaten their lunch here.",2658,302
2025-02-28,"Microsoft: Growth, Investments, and Future Valuation in AI and Cloud Dominance","* Microsoft’s stock has been stable, trading around $402.85, with a market cap of $2.96T.

Microsoft (MSFT) is maintaining its market leadership worth nearly $2.96 trillion. The market cap of its stocks is currently $2.96 trillion, currently trading at $402.85, reflecting its stable and firm trend over this year, ranging between $385.58 and $468.35 during a 52-week trading. While there have been minute movements in its stocks, its trend in total is generally sideways. Financially, Microsoft performed well in FY 2024, with its revenues improving 15.7% yearly, amounting to $245.1 billion, and earnings improving 21.8% to stand at $88.1 billion. The company’s consistent numbers support its growth prospects in its business divisions. Despite the challenges of escalating capital investment and increasing competition in AI, Microsoft's strategic investment in AI and cloud continues to drive growth. They are well positioned for stability in the long term and success in the future in a transforming technology landscape due to their investment in AI solutions, business solutions, and growth in the cloud.

Microsoft’s collaboration with AI models will offer the company tremendous growth in the near future. Since the explosion of AI, the Microsoft Azure program has become invaluable to other enterprises looking to integrate AI into their platforms. The high quality of Azure’s programs is a massive growth driver for MSFT. It has experienced a YoY revenue growth of 31%, which is over 3 percent above the predicted 5-year CAGR of AI models. Microsoft Cloud itself also experienced a notable 21% YoY increase in revenue and 12% growth in revenue in Q2. In January of this year, MSFT gained permission to add the Open AI model to their neural network, Copilot. These companies’ collaboration takes advantage of the $13B revenue run rate (predicting future revenue based on a company’s current revenue) of AI models and their YoY growth of 157%–175%. MSFT’s AI programs will gain huge amounts of revenue from the 345 million users using its services.

Microsoft is making a massive investment in its future, expecting to spend around $80 billion on capital expenditures this year - nearly double what it spent just a couple of years ago ($44–$55 billion). Most of this money is going toward building AI-powered data centers and expanding its cloud infrastructure, ensuring the company stays ahead in the rapidly evolving tech space. In the short term, this aggressive spending is putting pressure on free cash flow (FCF), which was about $70 billion over the past year and even saw a 29% drop year-over-year in Q2 FY25. But Microsoft is playing the long game—by fiscal 2026, FCF is expected to recover to $82.38 billion as these investments start paying off. This is a familiar playbook for Microsoft, much like when it bet big on cloud computing years ago. The short-term financial squeeze is real, but the payoff could be enormous, setting Microsoft up for 15+ years of sustained growth and solidifying its position as a leader in AI and cloud computing.

In terms of current valuation metrics, Microsoft's current stock price as of February 1st, 2025, is 121.95, and the forward P/E ratio is 33.4x. Additionally, its expected earnings per share (EPS) for Fiscal Year 2026 is $15.04, as well as a 12-month target price of $490, based on earnings growth and valuation expectations. In terms of projected price target calculations, the standard valuation formula is used, and via the given EPS for 2026 and P/E ratio, it is projected that the stock price by the end of fiscal 2026 will be approximately $500. This, however, is under the pretext that Microsoft maintains a P/E ratio of 33.4x. Stock valuation fluctuates based on market conditions; thus, if the market decides that Microsoft deserves a lower valuation, for instance, a P/E ratio of 30 instead of 33.4, the target price would change, falling to around $451. This suggests that if Microsoft’s stock trades at a more conservative multiplier, the price might be closer to $451 instead of $500. Microsoft's Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is at 13.3%, meaning that Microsoft's stock would be growing at a healthily above-average rate compared to the broader market. Microsoft's cloud computing (Azure) and AI services are key growth drivers as AI-related revenue is projected to exceed $10 billion annually, growing at 175% year-over-year. The growth of overall revenue, at approximately 12-13% per year, supports earnings growth. The growth margins are expected to be 68-70% in FY 2025 and FY 2026, indicating profitability, and the Free Cash Flow (FCF) is expected to exceed $65 billion in FY 2025 and $72 billion in FY 2026, meaning that Microsoft has money to reinvest or return to shareholders. However, risks include the fact that their valuation relies heavily on AI expansion; therefore, if AI adoption slows, the stock might not meet growth targets. Additionally, a declining P/E ratio could bring the price closer to $431 instead of $500. Competition also plays a key role, as rivals such as Google Cloud and AWS (Amazon Web Services) are also growing their AI and cloud businesses, which could impact Microsoft's market share and interest rates. Finally, economic conditions influence investor sentiment, ultimately affecting stock valuation. Overall, Microsoft remains a strong investment, but future performance depends on AI adoption, earnings growth, and maintaining investor confidence.

Microsoft integrates security into its cloud and AI strategy with a Zero Trust approach, AI-driven threat intelligence, and a unified security platform. Its key security solutions include Microsoft Defender, an AI-powered XDR for endpoints, cloud, and email; Microsoft Sentinel, a cloud-native SIEM and SOAR for real-time threat detection; and Microsoft Entra, an IAM solution with multi-factor authentication, conditional access, and identity governance. Microsoft’s cybersecurity business is rapidly growing, generating over $20 billion annually at a double-digit rate, serving 785,000+ customers, and investing $1 billion+ annually in security research and development. AI-driven security processes 65 trillion signals daily, enabling real-time threat mitigation. This robust security framework strengthens Azure adoption, AI deployments, and enterprise trust, making security a growth driver rather than an add-on. By embedding security across its cloud ecosystem, Microsoft reinforces its leadership in cybersecurity while accelerating Azure and AI innovation.

TL;DR: Microsoft maintains market leadership with a stable stock price, driven by AI and cloud growth. Heavy CapEx investment impacts short-term cash flow but positions the company for long-term gains. Valuation suggests a price target of \~$500 by FY2026, but risks include free cash flow declines and AI adoption uncertainty. Quantum computing advancements and a strong cybersecurity ecosystem further solidify Microsoft’s market strength.",12,3

For the lab tasks, they give you sandbox credentials to work with. The tasks were mostly about setting up service hooks, building basic pipelines, and tweaking branch policies. Pretty straightforward stuff, but they can take some time.

A couple of the MCQs were a bit tricky, so my advice: knock out the MCQs as quickly as you can and make sure you save 40-45 minutes for the lab tasks. Those can get time-consuming, especially if your internet connection isn’t great. The loading time was super annoying at times.

2025-03-12,Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone,"President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.

But there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump’s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.

Backing off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was ""significant"" and ""very justified,"" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

It ""may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,"" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.

The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text.”

No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.

Final remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.

It didn’t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.

""Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,"" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.

It argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google’s monopoly control.”

They also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.

But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.

Anthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).

“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google’s AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.

Derek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.

""They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,"" he said.

""I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.""

The tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.

""What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.

""It seems ill-timed to do that.""

The DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.

It asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox.

That is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.

Bernstein analysts have estimated Apple’s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.

Google countered the DOJ’s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.

McCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.

""Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,"" McCareins said.

2025-03-14,is it worth moving from Amazon to MSFT,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently an L6 Finance Manager at Amazon HQ2 and have been with the company for three years. I recently received an offer for an L62 Senior Finance Manager role at Microsoft. The total comp ranges from $180k-$201k, which is pretty comparable to where I’m at now.

Honestly, I’m feeling pretty burnt out at Amazon so a change would be welcome

The tricky part? The Microsoft role was originally supposed to be based in Reston but now they want it to be in Redmond. I’m from the East Coast, with all my family within an hour’s drive, so while I am open to moving to the West Coast I would be moving to a location where I would be completely alone.

I’m open to relocating, but I’m torn between a fresh start and staying close to my support system.

Anyone else made a similar move? Is the switch to Microsoft worth it, especially considering the relocation? Would love to hear your thoughts or any advice on how to approach this decision!",133,60

However I still don't understand why I received no warnings from them that my trial was ending and my resources would be inaccessible. Seems like they could have just said ""hey, start paying or we are deleting this"". I was able to recreate everything from the MI, but as a SQLDB instead (cheaper and sufficient for my use case). I guess I should thank them for helping me save money. I appreciate everyone who provided advice and insights (except the miserable oaf who pretty much told me I was an idiot that didn't do anything right; that guy can go suck a railroad spike). ",14,29
2025-03-24,Microsoft documentation a bear to read,"Hi,

I'm a novice to cloud computing and Azure is the chosen cloud provider for my company. I can do simple stuff like implementing a Function but when I need to dive deeper into a topic and tries to read Microsoft's documentation, such as

[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-concurrency#http-trigger-concurrency](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-concurrency#http-trigger-concurrency)

  
I find it hard to read and understand, almost *unnecessarily* complicated, with links linking to another page, and so on. Before you know it, you have 5 tabs open just to try to understand one thing. Are there any better learning resources? like maybe videos/diagrams that makes things more clear?

I don't know if this is a MIcrosoft thing or is cloud computing in general this complicated.

2025-03-25,SQL Managed Instance Disappeared with No Trace of Existance,"Hello, I don't know if I'm going insane, but we started receiving error messages last night regarding a downstream process that was failing. I went to look into it and discovered that our SQL Managed Instance we were using in said process no longer exists. What's worse is that I cannot find it ANYWHERE in our Azure Portal. It's almost like it never existed. I have opened a Critical Support request with Microsoft, but I wanted to know if anyone else is having this issue, or has had this issue.

EDIT: Adding a screenshot of the Activity Log. There is some sort of deletion event, but it doesn't seem to specify a user who initiated it.

UPDATE 1: I was able to locate the log records for the deletions of the two DBs on the instance AND the instance itself. The two DBs were deleted Mar 22 \~4:50PM PT and the Managed Instance was deleted Mar 23 \~3:20AM PT. I don't see these in the Activity Log, but rather the Change Analysis screen. The JSON in the Change Analysis records does not provide any additional detail. Also, where it should say who/what initiated the deletions, instead it says ""N/A"".

2025-04-07,What does the US export that most countries need? MSFT seems better positioned than most.,"Ironically, microsoft is the only major tech company that is minimally effected by the tariffs. They dont import or sell much hardware and thus their sales wont be impacted by tariffs. Nor do they rely on ad revenue (which collapses if people start buying fewer nonessential items due to price hikes). Microsoft mainly sell software that is manufactured in the US to the rest of the world which should somewhat insulate them from direct effects of the tariffs.   

People in US will definitely start buying less nonessentials when prices shoot up (which will even hurt google ad revenue) and what will people do with the money thats not being spent on buying cheap goods from china. Im sure some of them would want to invest it.

Maybe the countries that want to decrease the trade deficit to make trump happy will buy more msft software and use it and AI to automate away middle management tasks. What else does the US even export that most countries actually need? Oil and Software seem to be our main exports.

Even if the EU passes tariffs on MSFT, there isnt really a viable alternative to windows and office. It seems unlikely that many people or corporations would be in a position to stop using microsoft software if the price goes up.

If a corporation sees an opportunity to save millions by automating away middle management jobs with software, they will likely go forward even if the software’s costs goes up a bit. 

As for nonEU countries, none of them are really in a position to snub Trump, the US is too big a market to ignore. I imagine they will be in a frenzy to figure out what they can import from the US to appease Trump and get their tariffs lowered or suspended. And automation software seems to be one of their best options.

Plus their advancements in quantum computing could potentially prove lucrative down the line, especially if they find a way to use quantum computing to make LLMs more efficient.",62,19

2025-04-16,Netflix Stock Pops After Report Streaming Giant Aims To Double Revenue by 2030,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-stock-pops-report-streaming-160434535.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-stock-pops-report-streaming-160434535.html)

# Key Takeaways

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

Last week, Morgan Stanley analysts named Netflix a [“top pick,”](https://www.investopedia.com/netflix-a-top-pick-for-morgan-stanley-on-expected-resilience-to-a-weaker-market-11712037) arguing the company could be well-positioned to withstand the current tariff landscape. The streaming giant has shown ""momentum” in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company’s overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

Our entire project is tied to these accounts, and I have over 100 emails linked to them. It’s now forcing me to install an authenticator app, but I’m not permitted to use a phone for these accounts, so I can’t install it — and there’s no option to bypass it.

Support called a few times and mentioned another department would follow up, but now they’ve stopped responding altogether. At this point, who can I contact to resolve this?

Edit: I guess it’s so normal to be a paying Microsoft customer and being left out without an answer and Support is ghosting is so normal. I don’t even see a single person being surprised by that.

BYD - leading EV company, went public this year and USA China trade agreement is promising

NRG - Energy company that recently made a 12 billion acquisition deal 

VSTRA - Energy company positioning themselves to power the AI boom

NVIDIA - They are positioned pretty well and will have high demand for their chips

MICROSOFT - Heavily investing into AI and cloud computing e.g. azure


Either gonna go with NRG or VSTRA, probably VSTRA for long term growth

I’m a 2025 passout currently pursuing my B.Tech in CSE, and I’m aiming to get shortlisted and crack the SDE-1 role at Microsoft. I’ve been working on DSA and some projects, but I’m not sure what exactly Microsoft looks for in candidates — both for shortlisting and during interviews.

A few questions I have:
	•	What kind of resume stands out to Microsoft for an off-campus shortlisting?
	•	How strong does my DSA need to be? (I’m solving on Leetcode, medium-level problems mostly)
	•	Any specific topics or resources you recommend?",36,8
2025-05-22,Microsoft Hiked O365 Annual Price by a whopping 30%!,"It looks like this officially started in February and I'm only seeing it now because my annual subscription renewal is coming up.  I'm seriously considering terminating the service.  My family mostly uses GSuite applications anyway... It is what the schools teach our kids and what most non-profits I work with use as well.  

**Anyone else ditching O365 due to the price hike?**

From the email from MSFT:

The recruiter seemed okay and even asked about my availability next week. But at the end, she mentioned a specific Azure tool and said, “It’s important for the role, but I’ll check with the team since you have similar experience.”

Now I’m worried I might get rejected just for that. Has anyone been in a similar spot where they didn’t know a specific tool but still moved forward? This is my first FAANG interview, and I’d be really disappointed",34,42

2025-06-16,"Life is finite. Risk aversion. (Once bitten, Twice shy.)","Some day I will die. I do not know when, but I know I will not live forever.

Every dollar I make in salary at my workplace represents a minute, hour, day, or some other unit of time I will NEVER get back. It represents time I'm not spending with family and time I'm not out enjoying myself.

Watching that money disappear is like shaving years off my life. Hell, I'd say burning it may even be more productive since some people at least get some form of enjoyment out of smoking cigarettes...

Now obviously, I need that money to afford food and whatnot, so I can't go quitting my job. But I do not spend frivolously on luxury goods. I live in a modest house in the suburbs and drive a 20 yr old, 4 cylinder Japanese compact hatchback.

\--------------------

Late in 1999, I was given a $3k High School graduation present. Opened an eTrade account and bought a bunch tech stocks (Microsoft, Dell, IBM, Cisco, Juniper, etc) Made a couple thousand more in under a year. Figured I couldn't lose, as I had a background in tech. As an engineering student, I knew the industry. Or at least I thought I did.

By the early 2000s, my portfolio was worth three digits.

Before I pulled the plug and sold all my stocks, I was literally sitting on the computer the entirety of 2002, 2003, and 2004 hitting Refresh and watching my portfolio lose value.

I had some startup companies that were promising that ended up going under and their stock values ended up being ZERO.

I did not, and still to this day do not know where the money went. It just disappeared.

People tell me I sold in the dip when I should have bought more. I was in high school/college. I was working low end jobs and needed the money. I had no money to invest.

Few years later, I got grandmothers inheritance to the tune of $30k in 2005. Bought a house for cash in the boonies and put another $10k in my own savings into it (paint, carpet, trim work, etc.) Sold the house for $65k three months later.

Wanted a bachelor pad, so I bought another small house,  closer to where I wanted to live on an ARM in 2006 and was upside down, two years later... $240k mortgage at 5% going up to 7% in three years on a house that appraised for $125k.

BUT at least I had a roof over my head. I still own that house and it's now a rental property.

I buy houses that I can flip/rent. They're tangible and I can control what work goes into them. If I want to make a house increase in value, I can renovate it. And an house will NEVER be worth NOTHING. Even if it burns down to the ground, the vacant land will have value. Insurance also covers losses on a house. Can't insure stocks.

I am VERY risk adverse, having been bitten before.

I can not control the value of a stock. I have zero influence if a company will release a gadget that will catch on and be the next big thing or if it will flop.

I can't subtly count cards, so I don't set foot in casinos.

I'm of the mindset that to invest in stocks, you need to have money that you're not afraid of losing.

How can I get out of this mindset so that I can YOLO all my savings on whatever wallstreetbets is peddling this week? People make bank day trading. I want to know their secret.",0,64

The core issue OpenAI is pushing to formally transition into a for-profit entity which could potentially dilute Microsoft influence and ownership stake in the company  especially concerning any future models beyond GPT-4

Sources say that unless key terms are agreed upon Microsoft is ready to fall back on its existing commercial agreement which guarantees access to OpenAI models through 2030  unless a competitor matches or exceeds Microsoft's deal

Another twist OpenAI transition plan reportedly needs Microsoft formal approval by Dec 31, 2025. Without that green light OpenAI may risk losing interest from outside investors like SoftBank and other late-stage capital.

Despite the headlines, Microsoft commercial use case remains protected in the shorttomid term. But the question now is who controls the roadmap to GPT-5 and beyond  and whether Microsoft sees enough ROI to keep playing ball.

Is MSFT losing strategic leverage here? Or are they just protecting their current ROI？Could this open the door for Google, Amazon, or even Meta to get in bed with OpenAI?How would a fractured OpenAI impact Azure’s AI moat vs AWS and GCP?MSFT may terminate expanded OpenAI deal as tensions rise over control and equity

2025-06-19,Acquired a UTMA account yesterday at 38 years old- and ~1300% gains,"I received a letter from E*trade this week about a brokerage account in mine and my dad’s name and after some research I discovered it was an old UTMA. It took a 5 min phone call for them to transfer the account into my taxable brokerage. 24 shares of Microsoft purchased at $34 now worth $11.5k.

A couple questions:

Will I owe capital gains taxes this year for receiving the account, even if I don’t withdraw?

Should I just leave it in MSFT and let it ride? I don’t follow MSFT and most of my other investing is in ETFs. 

There’s also a couple thousand in cash which I might move into the emergency fund that I’ve been aggressively building or hold for my backdoor Roth conversion in 2026 (both accounts with Fidelity). ",48,31

2025-07-08,Evercore: Will boost free cash flow for Microsoft and Oracle,"Some software companies, such as Microsoft ( NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Oracle ( NYSE: ORCL ), will benefit from higher free cash flow due to some elements of President Donald Trump's ‘One Great, Beautiful Act,’ Evercore ISI said.

We believe “A Great and Beautiful Act” could create a stealth free cash flow tailwind for profitable software companies, thanks to favourable changes in the tax treatment of R&D and capital expenditures,’ said Evercore analysts led by Kirk Materne (NYSE: ORCL). ), an Evercore analyst led by Kirk Materne, said. ‘Based on our analysis, the companies that benefit the most are those with high R&D intensity, high levels of capital expenditures, and that currently pay a significant amount of cash taxes.’

Evercore estimates that Microsoft's free cash flow will increase by $11 billion, or $1.50 per share. Oracle's free cash flow could increase by $3.3 billion, or $1.12 per share.

Mateen said, ""The average return for software companies that pay cash taxes is about 9%, largely due to more favourable R&D treatment ...... It's also worth noting that these are tax accounting changes, not financial accounting, and are largely based on the fact that tax benefits related to R&D and bonus depreciation are being brought forward .""

The bill includes the reinstatement of domestic R&D expensing. In addition, the bill provides for a 100 per cent rebate of bonus depreciation for qualified capital expenditures placed in service between 2025 and 2029.

Evercore noted, ‘The net impact is an additional 80% cash tax savings on 2025 R&D expenses.’ ""On the capital expenditure side, “bonus depreciation” on capital expenditure is gradually reduced from 2022 onwards, meaning that by 2025, 40 per cent of capital expenditure is immediately deductible for cash tax purposes, with the remaining 60 per cent amortised over the useful life of the asset. As a result of OBBB, all capital expenditures will receive 100 per cent “bonus depreciation” in the first year.""

Microsoft and Oracle are among the software companies benefiting from high capital expenditures. evercore estimates that the companies will spend $69.7 billion and $23.6 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. Much of this capex is related to artificial intelligence and data centre construction.

Evercore rates Microsoft Outperform and raised its price target to $515 from $500. Oracle is also rated Outperform and its price target was raised to $215 from $180.

Additionally, Evercore expects investment in artificial intelligence and the technology sector in general to increase as companies in a variety of industries reap the benefits.",8,1
2025-07-08,Hybrid AD & Re-Enabling De-Synced User Procedure Issues,"Hey all. Hoping for some guidance on a procedure I created that previously worked as part of my hybrid AD offboarding procedure, but now with the removal of MSOLSERVICE module, I'm struggling trying to find a way to re-sync my AD users back to Entra.

Here's sort of the general procedure and reasoning:

1. When a user leaves the company, I disable the user account and move them to a non-ADSynced OU. The reason I place the user object in a non-ADSynced OU is in order to convert the hybrid user object to a cloud only object in order to Hide the E-mail Address from the Global Address List (We do not have Exchange Schema - nor do I want to add this). So once the de-sync happens it deletes the Entra user and then I go to Deleted Users and restore. No problem. (We also want the mailbox to stay in tact, forwarding e-mails/delegate access etc.).

2. Now that the user is cloud-only, it allows me to flip the switch to hide e-mail from GAL. However my ADSync gives me errors. So to remedy the issue what I've previously been doing is using the MSOL module to delete the immutableID on the cloud-only object and that clears the error. 

https://preview.redd.it/il2h6qqaehbf1.png?width=394&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffccfdc92267b1e9d37597131962f00cdff50bbe

3. I've found a similar way to remove the immutableID on the cloud-only object using MSGraph and ADSyncTools module. 

Example: `Clear-ADSyncToolsOnPremisesAttribute -Identity '50a925be-1e22-4fbb-8ca2-4d56355d38a8' -onPremisesImmutableId`

Visually, on the Entra Properties it clears the ImmutableID, same as the MSOL method, so while I think all is good and while it fixes the ADSync errors, not all is good -- see next step below:

https://preview.redd.it/z33ya0qzehbf1.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae545e93d4d97bad3140fd1079dfa414e5198b9e

4. However if or when the user returns to the company, if I have to re-enable them, I reverse the process; uncheck hide e-mail from GAL and on the AD side I re-enable their account and move the user object back to a ADSynced OU. I run my delta-sync and ADSync is not happy and does not re-sync the AD user to the cloud only object despite the UPN and ProxyAddress match the same. There's not too much detail as why on the ADSync service manager log.

https://preview.redd.it/6zq6eun0ihbf1.png?width=1541&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fc033286a0316ddddb4c73d819f5ee95441b379

Essentially this new method using MSGraph and ADSyncTools modules is not working the same as the MSOLSERVICE module and right now as my work-around I've been deleting the AD user object and re-creating it, then it allows me to sync the object based on default UPN matching.

This *was* my procedure to remove the ImmutableID from the cloud-only object. 

`1. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run: Install-Module MSOnline`

`2. Login as your Admin account and run: Connect-MsolService`

`3. Next, run this to display the ImmutableID value: Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName` [`user@domain.com`](mailto:user@domain.com) `| select ImmutableID`

`4. Next run this to clear the ImmutableID, setting it to null value: Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName` [`user@domain.com`](mailto:user@domain.com) `-ImmutableId ""$null""`

`5. Run this again to verify the ImmutableID is null: Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName` [`user@domain.com`](mailto:user@domain.com) `| select ImmutableID`

`6. Now you can move the user object back to the proper OU, wait for the ADSync interval (10 mins) and verify the on-prem sync is set to yes.`

  
This is my new procedure to remove the ImmutableID from the cloud-only object (Does not work the same as MSOLSERVICE method to resync the on prem and cloud accounts):

`#Install the ADSync & MSGraph PowerShell modules. Open PowerShell as Admin and run:`

`1. Install-Module ADSyncTools`

`2. Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -Scope AllUsers -Force`

`#Import the module`

`3. Import-Module ADSyncTools`

`#Login to your MS Admin account`

`4. Connect-MgGraph -Scopes 'User.ReadWrite.All'`

`*MS Login Page will appear, sign-in with your Admin account.`

`#Change the identity string with the user's Object ID`

`5. Clear-ADSyncToolsOnPremisesAttribute -Identity '50a925be-1d22-4fbb-8ca2-4d56355d38a8' -onPremisesImmutableId`

`6. Verify the Immutable ID is cleared`

  
I'm just wondering what others are doing in this situation. Help is greatly appreciated. 

Thank you!",1,8

2025-07-09,My experience as an FTE Azure Support Engineer at Microsoft - one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had,"I want to share my experience working as a full-time blue badge Azure Support Engineer at Microsoft, based in EMEA. I reported to two Indian managers (M1 and M2), both based in India. Seeing so many people here complain about Azure support quality, I can honestly say: I’m not surprised at all. In fact, as long as Microsoft continues outsourcing to India and similar developing countries, I don’t believe things will ever truly improve.

The workload was absolutely insane - endless ticket queues, unrealistic expectations, and no real support from leadership. The volume just kept piling up, and you were expected to work through it all without complaint.

One of the most frustrating aspects was the cultural disconnect. The way Indian management approaches customer service is completely different from Western standards. I remember getting into an argument with my Indian manager because they insisted we call customers just to try to get good feedback scores - even when the customers had clearly specified that they preferred to be contacted by email.

I tried to push back, pointing out how disrespectful and ineffective this was, but I was shut down. The manager insisted it would “improve the customer experience.” It was obvious to anyone with common sense that it was a bad idea, but the culture of fear was strong - no one dared to speak up. If you did, you were labeled “not a team player.”

There were times I got into heated arguments with my manager because customers would get angry when I called them against their preference, yet when something went right, the manager would take credit. It was demoralizing.

Honestly, I felt ashamed working there, and at Microsoft in general. I was forced to do things I didn’t believe in - just to keep up appearances or chase metrics that didn’t reflect real service quality. The management was incompetent, detached from the realities of both the job and the customers, and completely focused on numbers over people.

Edit: Just to clarify, I’ve already left the company and the CSS organization. If you think my experience wasn’t real, that I wasn’t a true blue badge FTE, or whatever else - you’re free to believe that. Honestly, I don’t care if the whole department gets laid off (especially considering how many layoffs Microsoft is doing these days).

I just wanted to share my experience and vent a little, that’s why I specifically marked this post as “Rant.” This job caused me a lot of mental stress over the past few years, and the experience was unbelievably bad. When I saw the comments here about Azure support, I thought my story might help shed some light on why things are the way they are. If you think I’m lying or just trash-talking a former employer, that’s fine. Believe what you want. I have zero intention of ever working for them again, and honestly, I wouldn’t recommend this job to my worst enemy.",753,181

2025-07-16,Honest Opinions Needed: Is Microsoft Security Copilot Really Worth It?,"Hey friends,

I really need your honest feedback about Microsoft Security Copilot.

I recently started using it, and I currently have one unit. From the very first trigger, it failed due to “capacity full.” 😂

I’m genuinely wondering:
	•	Is it really worth the high price?
	•	Are there any hidden features or benefits that we’re not aware of yet?
	•	How do you actually use it in your environment?
	•	Does it deliver real value, or is it just another fancy AI assistant?

Please share your experience, advice, and any lessons learned.
I’d really appreciate any recommendations or warnings.

Thanks a lot in advance!

2025-07-16,Microsoft Security Test Automation Framework,"Hi everyone! Thanks for the great response to my latest post. I really appreciate the support.

I've noticed that many people are struggling to get a good overview of their Microsoft tenant's security. That's why I want to introduce Maester. It is a PowerShell based Microsoft security test automation framework designed to help you stay in control of your tenant’s security configuration. Maester is an initiative by Merill Fernando, Faben Bader and Thomas Naunheim.

Some time ago, I also wrote a blog post on how you can get started with Maester, which is free to use. [Maester — Microsoft Security Test Automation Framework](https://cloudtips.nl/maester-microsoft-security-test-automation-framework-4edc4f061508) & [Maester Website](https://maester.dev/)

I am currently working on adding new tests for Azure configuration, such as ensuring that write permissions are required to create new management groups. 

By default, all Entra ID principals can create new management groups. This introduces governance and security risks, as it allows any user to modify the structure of your environment. 

To address this, Azure offers a setting that requires write permissions for creating new management groups. Enabling this ensures that only authorized users can make changes to your management group hierarchy. Maester will now also provide a recommendation to validate this setting.

However, I am also looking for more ideas. If there is any Azure configuration setting you would like to see monitored, feel free to let me know in the comments. ❤️

2025-07-16,Seeking portfolio optimization advice rolled over Ira,"
Hello,
I recently rolled over approximately $15,000 from my previous employer's 401(k) into a Fidelity IRA. My goal is to build a strong, long-term growth portfolio by evenly investing in stocks, with ongoing monthly contributions.
Here's my initial allocation breakdown for the $15,000:
 * Technology/Growth:
   * Microsoft (MSFT): $2000
   * Apple (AAPL): $2000
   * NVIDIA (NVDA): $1,500
   * Amazon (AMZN): $1,000
   * Palantir (PLTR): $1,000
   * Snowflake (SNOW): $1,000
   * Super Micro Computer (SMCI): $1,000
 * ETFs (Tech-Focused):
   * Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ): $1,500
   * VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH): $1,500
 * Consumer/Healthcare/Staples:
   * Visa (V): $750
   * Costco Wholesale (COST): $750
   * Procter & Gamble (PG): $1,000
   * Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): $1,000

My Objectives:
 * Long-term capital appreciation.
 * Diversification across promising sectors/companies.
 * Consistency with monthly contributions.
Questions for the Community:
 * Given my initial selections and goals, do you have any suggestions for optimizing this portfolio?
 * Are there any particular stocks you would add, remove, or adjust the weighting of?
 * Are there any sectors or types of companies I might be overlooking for a ""strong portfolio""?
Any insights or recommendations would be greatly appreciated as I look to build a robust investment foundation.
Thank you!

2025-07-17,ExpressRoute private peering - site-to-site VPN overlay,"I have an upcoming task:
* Design and configure a site-to-site vpn over an expressRoute circuit private peering, and have some questions around routing.
* This has been driven due to regulation that enforces encryption of PII data in transit.
* The intention is to use a VPN gateway with private IPs enabled and no BGP config. On-premises vpn termination points will be x2 fortigate firewalls deployed in HA.

## I've read through MSFT docs: 
* [Configure a Site-to-Site VPN connection over ExpressRoute private peering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/site-to-site-vpn-private-peering)
* [Using S2S VPN as a backup for ExpressRoute private peering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/use-s2s-vpn-as-backup-for-expressroute-privatepeering)

## High level arhcitecture of the existing environment
* Hub and spoke network topology
* Existing azure firewall in the hub VNet, controll ingress/egress traffic flow
* Spoke subnets have routes that set the next hop IP to the internal IP address of the Azure firewall
* ExpressRoute circuit provisioned and advertising hub VNet and peered spoke VNet cidr ranges to on-premises via BGP


## Questions
* The documentation alludes to advertising specific CIDR ranges over the s2s VPN, while larger Azure CIDRs traverse the expressRoute circuit. However, what is the routing approach?
  * My thought process on ensuring Azure prefers specific CIDR ranges was that, a spoke subnet would: have a route to the azure firewall > the firewall would the offload packets to the gateway subnet > the gateway subnet would then have a next hop ip of the VPN gateway > the VPN gateway forwards traffic to on-premises FortiGate vpns.
* Local network gateways require a public IP, but surely that would negate the point of an overlay VPN. The intention is for traffic to traverse the expressRoute circuit in an encrypted tunnel. Would local network gateways support defining the fortigate VPN endpoint IP, where you would typically set an on-premises public IP?

Apologies if my thought process seems all over the place! Seem to have hit a wall when it comes to understanding the design from a high-level and route preference!",2,9

2025-07-19,Do you consider MSFT part of FAANG?,"I work in tech. I know the term FAANG first came to light around 2013 and kind of stuck around because at the time comapnies like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google were basically at the top of their respective tech fields and were part of our everyday lives. Microsoft was doing good too but not exploding like it has since then. 

For me FAANG isnt necessarily just those 5 companies, it's companies that tend to be able to compete with these companies. Companies that tend to have similar benefits/pay and give RSUs like crazy to their employees. 

I know MSFT is one of those companies that pays like big tech bu tnot necessarily like FAANG but from what I hear their benefits are up there with the rest. What I always heard was MSFT pays a little lower because they value work life balance more than the rest (though from friends I hear that isnt the case in some projects in Azure). 

I had always thought that if I said the sentence ""MSFT is FAANG"" most people wouldnt bat an eye but seems like half the people I talk to agree with me, but the other half say it's not FAANG and shouldnt even be considered FAANG. I get the reasoning that it's not part of the acronym, but again I dont think about the 5 companies when I say FAANG, I think about companies in that area that have basically become monopolies in a certain degree and have a global clientele that you can say the company name anywhere and people will know what it is. Companie sthat have worldwide offices and you doubt they will go away in 100 years and still be at the same level and growing like crazy. That's what I think of MSFT.

Today's pre-market index gains, especially in Nasdaq futures, reflect the market's expectations for tech stocks. Here are four stock moves I'm watching:



🔹 Microsoft (MSFT): down 0.3% premarket as SharePoint software was revealed to be under “active attack”. The software is widely used within government and business. Microsoft has issued a security patch, but the incident may have a short-term impact on customer confidence.



🔹 Verizon (VZ): Shares up 4.6% premarket after Q2 results beat estimates and raised the lower end of its full-year profit estimate range to 1%-3%. Strong wireless service revenue growth and healthy customer base expansion. Adjusted EPS of $1.22 beat estimates.



🔹 Alaska Airlines (ALK): up 0.9% premarket. Operations have now resumed despite a nationwide flight suspension due to an IT outage. Both the company and its subsidiaries have suffered recent cybersecurity incidents, which may prompt them to step up their IT investments in the future.



🔹 Equinix (EQIX): 2.5% pre-market gain after activist investor Elliott adds stake. Elliott has reportedly become one of the top 10 shareholders in EQIX. The company is a data center REIT with potential long-term upside in AI data processing needs.

For Microsoft, this security incident may be a stock price disruptor in the short term, but the long term still needs to look at its cloud services and AI deployment capabilities.



Verizon's fundamentals are solid and its valuation remains attractive, especially against the backdrop of a high dividend yield.

I'm trying to add a new one that connects to Microsoft.Graph and returns whether the supplied user ID is licensed for Teams Enterprise Voice.   All of it works in PowerShell 7 on my local workstation but when I try to run the same commands within an Azure function, I get an error that Microsoft.Identity.Client 4.67.2.0 cannot be found.

Graph is pretty big so rather than put it in my requirements.psd1, I've uploaded version 2.28.0 (also tried 2.29.1) into the Modules folder.  So it's not having an issue finding Microsoft.Graph.Authentication (the module used by the command throwing the error).  

I'm a relative notice here so any help would be appreciated.   

Here's the command throwing the error:

Could not find or load a specific file. 

I have tried adding Microsoft.Identity.Client to my requirements file, no luck.  


UPDATE:
In case somebody else has this problem.  Download the version of PowerShell modules you use and look for the Microsoft.Identity.Client.DLL file.  Check the properties for the version and see if all the modules with this DLL can work with similar versions from the other modules.  Which ever modules loads first, it's that module's copy of the DLL that gets loaded and shared by other modules.

In my case, the issue turned out to be that I was using MicrosoftTeams 6.5, which has an older version of the .NET Microsoft.Identity.Client.DLL.

I brought the MicrosoftTeams module up to 7.2.0 and it played nicely with the Microsoft.Graph.Authication module (2.25 tested but probably would work with 2.29.1).",1,10

How much do they have room to grow, and is there a better play for pure cloud exposure? It would seem to me, their investment in OpenAI and Azure will be big for the AI industry moving forward, but there is the risk that AI doesn't find the profitability compared to spending people think it will. They clearly have the money to buy smaller players, and are still an industry leader for a reason.

Microsoft has built out a pretty comprehensive suite:

**Native Azure Cost Management Tools:**

* Cost Analysis in Azure Portal
* Built-in reporting capabilities
* Azure Advisor recommendations
* Azure Lighthouse for multi-tenant management
* Power BI integrations
* FinOps Hubs leveraging Power BI

**My main question:** If all third-party tools are essentially consuming the same Azure APIs and following Microsoft's recommended practices anyway, what's the real differentiator?

I get that some vendors might offer prettier dashboards or different UX approaches, but are there actually **functional gaps** in Microsoft's native tooling that justify paying for external solutions?

**Looking for insights on:**

* Are there specific use cases where third-party tools genuinely outperform native Azure cost management?
* What capabilities do external vendors provide that you can't achieve with the built-in Microsoft stack?
* For those who've evaluated both, was the ROI there for third-party solutions?

I'm curious if I'm missing something significant or if this is more about preference/familiarity than actual capability gaps.

“We’re innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt and grow in this new era, and this year, Azure surpassed $75 billion in revenue, up 34 percent, driven by growth across all workloads.”

For the quarter, Microsoft saw adjusted EPS of $3.65 on revenue of $76.4 billion. Wall Street was anticipating adj. EPS of $3.37 and revenue of $73.89 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus estimates. The company saw adj. EPS of $2.95 and revenue of $64.72 billion in the same period last year.

2025-08-02,I am really confused by the Azure AI Foundry / Microsoft Agents SDK's,"I've hit a major wall and am feeling pretty defeated, I'd really appreciate some insight on what I'm doing wrong.

My original understanding was that we use AI Foundry to build the 'brain' of our agents. It's through the foundry that we can create custom agents, offer them tools and now the SDK even includes native support for connecting to remote MCP servers (preview status).

However I want to bring the agent I built as a custom Copilot. This is where I'm getting frustrated.

So to be clear it's not as simple as 'hey just plug in the ID of your Foundry agent and it will be deployed to Copilot'. Instead it looks like you have to essentially convert your agent into a RESTful API endpoint that can be invoked by the Copilot using the Agents SDK. 

Is that right? Is there any documentation online about actually implementing this? ",8,19

2025-08-04,"""At that P/E rate, it would take 'X' years to recoup your investment""","I heard this today on a video about palantir. The guy said it has a P/E of 670, meaning it would take you 670 YEARS to get your money back.

I searched google and had a long conversation with ChatGPT that went nowhere. I now understand P/E ratios when it comes to ""*A P/E of 670 means you pay $670 for every $1 the company earns annually""* because I heard a great vending machine analogy and I read a comparison about Microsoft.

(**Machine** **costs $2,000 up front. makes $200 a year; P/E = 10x**).

What I **don't** understand is the notion that it would take **ME,** the **STOCK INVESTOR**, that much time.

I feel blindsighted by the fact that the only money I will ever see is from when the value of the stock goes up.

The ""670 years"" thing to me makes no sense. Not that it makes no sense, as in I understand where it's coming from, but it's just untrue to me. It makes no sense **simply because I don't get it**, and can't find any resources that know what I mean when posing my question.

The root of my problem may be my ability to explain my confusion, but I tried to do my best to put it all together here, and the clarity seems perfect to me. Maybe the issue is everyone takes this phrase a face value and doesn't think about its meaning?... Idk.

The vending machine analogy was a great way for me to understand it when it comes to someone who actually gets the profit, but I'm completely failing to comprehend its connection to investing.

2025-08-07,Msft stock and Open AI,"Microsoft stock potential for 1/3 OpenAI ?

I rarely listen to fincl pods. Even though I should do it more. I'm quite sure I'm late to this comment.
On Dumb Money pod one of the guys said MSFT may be gifted/buy 1/3rd of Altmans OpenAI.
Is MSFT stock price already priced in this potential?

The pod also discussed Anthropic and how difficult it was for this guy to have opportunity to invest in it.

What are others doing to try to capture OpenAI opportunities?

Any ideas why the insights workbook thinks its not right? I wonder what the workbook is actually looking for, any ideas?

I've confirmed that the VM's are associated to my DCR just fine and have the Azure monitor agent present.

Does it HAVE to be the same name? Or can anyone shred any light on what the workbook is looking for?

Many thanks!

UPDATE, Thanks for the comments below to advised that the workbook is hardcoded to look for a prefix of microsoft-avdi-, I updated the code to include, which worked fine :)

Any ideas why the insights workbook thinks its not right? I wonder what the workbook is actually looking for, any ideas?

I've confirmed that the VM's are associated to my DCR just fine and have the Azure monitor agent present.

Does it HAVE to be the same name? Or can anyone shred any light on what the workbook is looking for?

Many thanks!

UPDATE, Thanks for the comments below to advised that the workbook is hardcoded to look for a prefix of microsoft-avdi-, I updated the code to include, which worked fine :)

2025-08-19,Agent from Azure Foundry AI in Microsoft Teams,"Hi Guys, 
just another question about the topic please. My guess Microsoft wants Teams to be used as main UI but it’s not working right for me.

Context: 
We developed several no-code autonomous agents in Copilot Studio and we deployed those to Teams earlier this year. Everyone in our organization can already use them.
I don’t have a deep technical background — my expertise is in business — but there are technical specialists on my team.
Right now, we are working on several agents in the newly purchased Azure Foundry AI. Unfortunately, we are stuck with deploying agents from Azure Foundry directly to Teams.

Agent workflow example: text input -> llm -> python -> llm -> text output


It was easy with Copilot Studio, but Foundry AI is different. We tried using different user interfaces (other than Teams) to access models in Foundry, and those worked fine.
I understand that Azure Foundry is a pro-code environment, so deployment to Teams should also be pro-code. However, that doesn’t seem to help.

I’ve read all the threads about the same issue here and tried to make it work, but I haven’t succeeded yet.


Here are the approaches you suggested: 

1. Azure Foundry AI -> Copilot Studio -> Teams
YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7ZkM3n4dbQ
Tried to fetch model from Foundry through creation topic in Copilot Studio, but it didn’t work for me. Python isn’t available here.

2. Microsoft 365 SDK -> Teams 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/teams-ai-library/teams/overview#core-concepts
Looks like it suggest agent in container with separate VM and storage. Can’t understand why do I need Azure Foundry AI to do it this way? Wasn’t the idea of Foundry AI - All in one? The Agents SDK uses the Azure Bot Service, should it be separate subscription? Sounds crazy complicated to me.

3. Azure Foundry SDK -> Teams 
Where do we access Azure Agents APIs from? We need something in between Foundry and Teams user chat. Hasn’t researched yet.

4. Microsoft 365 Agent toolkit (former Teams Toolkit). 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/teams-ai-library/teams/agents-toolkit
Worked well with declarative agents developed in Visual Studio. Where is Foundry in this approach?


Guys, now question if I may.
Anyone here succeeded with Teams user interface for models/workflows from Azure Foundry? What is the right way to do it? 
Let’s talk please. I’m loosing faith :-)

2025-08-22,"Microsoft Fabric vs Azure Service Fabric, what is thought was the same.","I’ve felt confused at first and saw some peeps here too, so here’s a quick note of mine.

* Microsoft Fabric is the newer one (launched in 2023). It’s an all-in-one data and analytics platform that combines Power BI, Synapse, Data Factory, and Data Lake, among others. Think of it as a SaaS product for end-to-end data workflows. It’s mainly for data engineers, analysts, and business users.
* Azure Service Fabric has been around since 2015. It’s a distributed systems platform for running microservices and containers at scale. It’s what Azure uses internally for things like SQL DB and Event Hubs. This one’s more for app developers and architects.

In short, Microsoft Fabric is about analytics and data; Azure Service Fabric is about building and running cloud-native applications.

Has anyone here actually started using Microsoft Fabric in a real project?

2025-08-23,Federated Workload Identity: Service Principal vs Managed Idenity for GitHub Actions,"So, org is having me setup GitHub actions workflows for some new CI/CD stuff. Historically using ADO with Service Principal + client secret

I'm like cool. Clearly we'll use the azure/login action with OIDC. Most (all?) documentation concerning federated credentialsa and configuring this use managed identities [Example](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/quickstarts/github-actions?view=azure-devops&pivots=managed-identity)

I spent about a day digging into how a UMI is just an abstraction over top a Service Principal and was like coolio, so unless I *need* client secrets or something, I'll just use UMI.

New guy joins and asks why not SP (he'd never used UMI before). I ask him to list differences as execise and then he starts to understand how the overlap was incredibly high and drops it. Decided to ask him to give it some more thought to see if he could make compelling case.....

Which brings me here:

The more I think about it, *is* there a case to use SPs for anything that supports federated credentials via UMI? Maybe I'm wrong but it seems clear that federated workload identies (as a concept) was made with Managed Identity in mind and added to SP after the fact.

It's a little weird to create a UMI ***unassigned*** to an Azure resource specifically for the purpose of GitHub (and eventually ADO) to use OIDC to reach an internal ACR and such. But it doesn't introduce any question on how auth is working, is right there next to all the other UMIs being used for other use cases, and I appreciate how it's a more limited resource (ie. no one will be accidently assigning secrets to it or something and forgetting about it)

Most research on the topic just repeats the adage of ""use UMI for internal Azure resources and SP for external"", but federated credentials clearly broke that paradigm over its knee and the documentation basically treats SPs as a legacy system best forgotten

also, when MSFT themselves have both their documentation and the portal UI all about quickly setting up UMI, I'm like ""well clearly someone has a preference here""",12,29

2025-09-02,Manage Microsoft Tenant Admin Accounts Across Multiple Tenants - personal project!,"Hey everyone! I’ve been working on a project in Blazor called [Optymate](https://optymate.com), and I’d love for some of you to check it out and give feedback.

What is Optymate?  
This tool is designed to help companies manage admin accounts across multiple Microsoft Tenants.

If you’ve ever struggled with tracking who has admin access in which tenant, onboarding accounts in a standardized format (like display names), or securely offboarding accounts when someone leaves, I hope this is the tool for you.

Key Features:

* Admin account management: See all admin accounts across all tenants create accounts, track ownership, and easily offboard accounts when needed.

* Main tenant: By linking a main tenant, we can setup a way to create admin accounts for users in the main tenant, track the accounts (validate), and off board them globally.

* Custom Key Vault Integration: The idea behind this is that you can connect your own Azure Key Vault, so sensitive info (certificates, logins, etc) stays protected under your own security policies (IP whitelisting). Even if Optymate itself were compromised, attackers wouldn’t be able to access your key vault (due to whitelisting).

* There are other tools in Optymate: Optymate started as a hobby project for myself (as a learning curve), so there are other tools which for sure in the future will grow, but for now it’s focused on the admin account management.

There are a few points to keep in mind though:

* Beta: This is truly beta, expect bugs (for example: not all tables are sortable yet) and missing documentation, but probably much more.

* Sleeping Database: If you get a timeout or error on first login, it’s likely just the database waking up (I’ll enable always on later)

* Looking for Testers: I’m hoping some of you will give it a try and let me know what you think or what could be improved!

I’d appreciate your feedback! Please be nice 😉

2025-09-09,I don't understand Azure's behavior for backend routing from App Gw. to App Service,"Hi! I'm looking for some answers regarding the Subnet Delegation within App Gateway, Azure VNET and App Service scenario.

Scenario (all services are located in single region):  
1x App Service which is integrated to a VNET on a subnet ""A""  
1x App Gateway which has the App Service as a backend using the public FQDN (azurewebsites.net), and two frontend configurations (Public and Private where Private is integrated to the VNET on subnet ""B"")  
1x Azure VNET where I have subnet ""A"" with App Service integration and ""Microsoft.Web/serverFarms"" delegation and subnet ""B"" where I have App Gw integration within Private Frontend IP Configuration.

I'm using Private Frontend IP Configuration on the App Gw. which is intended for other purposes than serving the App Service and overall this private frontend config is not important in this scenario.

So what I see and what I think I see:  
In the App Gw. logs I can see that requests for the App Service backend are being send to Public IP address of the App Service (which makes sense because I'm using public FQDN of the app service in the backend settings on the App Gw.). However, the App Service has strict network configuration where every inbound communication is blocked by default except communication coming from the VNET.  
So now when I check App Service HTTP logs I see that the requests from the App Gw. are coming from the private IP of the VNET thanks to ""Microsoft.Web/serverFarms"" subnet delegation on the subnet ""A"". I'm sure that this is the communication from App Gw.  
I understand that even when the App Gateway is calling the public FQDN (IP address) of the App Service backend, Azure is smart enough to re-route this traffic privately through the VNET, to the App Service so the traffic never leaves Azure infrastructure.  
Now, what I don't understand is the decision of Azure which source private IP address of the VNET will be chosen as a client IP of the App Gw. instance when routing the backend traffic to the App Service. In the App Service HTTP logs I see that the backend communication always comes from the subnet ""B"" network address prefix of the VNET. Why subnet ""B""? Is this due to a fact that the App Gw. is deployed to subnet ""B"" using Private Frontend IP Configuration EVEN when the private Frontend IP Configuration has no role in this scenario at all?

EDIT: Sorry ""Microsoft.Web/serverfarms"" subnet delegation on subnet ""A"" has nothing to do with this behavior.

EDIT: Oh, I see now. The subnet ""B"" has the service endpoint ""Microsoft.Web"" assigned to it probably thanks to private frontend IP configuration. This seems to be an answer why Azure decides to always use private IP from the subnet ""B"" as the source of the backend communication to app service on subnet ""A"".",13,4

2025-09-10,$CRWV DD - CoreWeave is Low Balling Their Year End Guide by 22%-40% while $NBIS Has their Microsoft Deal Already Max Priced for 2025,"Contracts are nice but there is a major caveat -- How much can you actually scale to realize those revenues. Now, I am fully disclosing upfront that I expect NBIS to run a lot higher from here. I may be wrong but that's what I expect and that's my bet.

Still, Nebius trades at a premium when it comes to CoreWeave based on core cloud revenues. The price to annual recurring revenue is quite telling.

**Cloud revenue ratio**

* Metric | Q2 CRWV | Q2 NBIS | Ratio
* Cloud rev | $1.213B | $105.1M | \~11.5–12×

**Run-rate valuation (apples-to-apples)**

* Company | Market cap (we’re using: CRWV $48B; NBIS $22.9B) | ARR (cloud) | P/ARR
* CRWV | 48B | \~$4.85B | \~9.9×
* NBIS | 22.9B | \~$0.43B | \~53×

To be fair, post IPO lock-up there has been selling by insiders for CoreWeave that have had their share for a very long time. The disparity of the P/ARR is most likely due to that and not the debt financing. Sure people rail on that because they have nothing better to due but I assure you when the selling stops this stock will pop. Selling as of now is a momentum killer for CoreWeave.

With that being said, there is a reality and to me that reality is grounded by one fact alone. How much MegaWatts of power can you stand-up by end-of-year. Then to normalize that we can take current Q2 known revenues and apply them to what we know as being current standing powered shells or MW's.

It doesn't matter what the contracts are that are put into the backlog the game here is what can you actually bring online in terms of actively running powered shells. Literally the contracts are written this way. You don't come online-no pay, no delivered throughput of GPU'S - you don't get paid. If it's bad enough you can lose the entire contract.

Now, I am not totally sure what Nebius's current standing powered shell capacity is in terms of MW's but I am estimating somewhere between 40 - 55 current MW's. Remember the NJ Vineland rollout, which Microsoft just contracted to, is for that facility. If someone knows of another one please let me know. As of now, it's phase 1 2025 \~100 MW and phase 2 2026 \~100 MW although it is said can expand up to 300-MW and perhaps there will be great motivation for this. After all, Mark Zuckerberg did say he was putting up GPU tent cities.

The last thing before we get into graphs and figures. You'll begin to question the Microsoft contract for Nebius and how they will actually be able to achieve that without perhaps rolling into capacity handovers to CoreWeave or others just to buy them more time perhaps. Meaning, $17 billion can't possibly be a revenue for Nebius recognized in their quarters for probably 3 years or more.

This would be the major analyst question on upcoming Nebius calls that I want to hear the answer too. 100,200,300 MW isn't going to bring in more than what you are kind of guiding to on the top end of 2026 at 200 MW \~$500 - $700 M quarterly revenues by end of 2026. Surely that is not coming anywhere close in 2025. The contract is through 2031 but if they want to realize more of that revenue now then they are going to have to hurry and build and procure power as fast as humanly possible.

Again, this is a bit of an advantage for CoreWeave because they have so many data centers up and running and so many more coming online even in this year.

**NBIS NJ Vineland rollout and corresponding MSFT contract**

* Phase | Year | MW | Notes
* Phase 1 | 2025 | \~100 | contracted
* Phase 2 | 2026 | \~100 | contracted
* Expandable | Future | up to 300 | site design cap

**Baseline inputs of revenue generated per known MW's**

* Company | Q2 cloud rev | Active MW (Q2) | $/MW/qtr
* CRWV | $1.213B | \~470 | \~$2.58M
* NBIS | $105.1M | \~40–55 (use 50 midpoint) | \~$2.10M (range \~$1.91–2.63M)

https://preview.redd.it/5pcgvchk4cof1.png?width=2616&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ddfce7ea4f21947704c643845420b095a1eb2c7

So now that we have a normalized Revenue per MW or R / MW now we can analyze our second graph in earnest. For the Year-End-2025 this is where each company would be for their respective MegaWatt online completions.

Simply, CoreWeave is expected / guided to bring online > 900 MW of total power active YE'25 and Nebius is expected to bring on \~100 MW of total power active YE'25.

**YE’25 MW & implied Q4 cloud revenue**

* Company | YE MW target | Low/Mid/High $/MW | Implied Q4 rev
* (CRWV: >900 MW; NBIS: \~100 MW)

https://preview.redd.it/ddmwt45o4cof1.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=969a0198016c211b09af93d70da0a04a7dd3888b

Now what's interesting here is that one has guided to the top and one has low balled to the bottom.

If you use the $1.91 - $2.63M for Nebius you would assume on 100 MW of year-end power they would be at a Q4 revenue projection of $.19B - $.263B and their corresponding guide is $.225-$.275B per quarter. That is right in line and a little higher even for the maxed out scale of 100 MW by ye'25.

On the other hand, CoreWeave has a 22%(top)-40%(bottom) upside on their current ranged guide. So if we're tracking that's a massive whisper number that if they meaningfully bring more than 900 MW online we could see some pretty wild beats on the earnings heading into 2026.

* **CoreWeave:** Our implied **Q4 ≈ $2.32B**/qtr vs. guidance: **Q3 $1.26–$1.30B** and FY’25 **$5.15–$5.35B**, which implies **Q4 need ≈ $1.66–$1.90B**. So our figure is **\~22–40% above** the guidance-implied Q4.
* **Nebius:** Our implied **Q4 ≈ $0.19–$0.26B**/qtr vs. YE’25 **ARR guidance $0.9–$1.1B** (**≈$0.225–$0.275B per quarter**). So our figure is **within or just below** their guided band.

Visually this is what CoreWeave's surprise guides may yield.

https://preview.redd.it/9ieydcgq4cof1.png?width=2223&format=png&auto=webp&s=36683ef74b32c8604fe94c57a2a3057eb79a9362

Look at the comparison between both CoreWeave and NBIS in terms of where they are guiding per predicted active powered capabilities by year-end.

To illustrate the point here are two Q4 predictive sensitivity guides based on increases/decreases in R / MW.

CoreWeave could whisper out to a major upside because they're MW projection for revenue is coming in lowballed. Red is the current guide and black squares are the reasonably expected guide with powered shells coming online.

https://preview.redd.it/pztqi2nt4cof1.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9a9bba8db0c4a99e3b749b21c7c4de473d1b6c1

For Nebius because they've guided so high you only can see an effective top end of their guide range.

https://preview.redd.it/mdnstgcw4cof1.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aa3212d3e485cd3f396d68d13aca4fb9a2a1a04

With all that said, and again with the caveat of CoreWeave is post IPO selling. How is the P/ARR not more normalized. At some point they either all go to \~10 or one raises and the other recedes. The sky is blue and the sun is white; yeah I know.

BUT can CoreWeave not have the luxury of a little more leeway to their P/ARR once the selling stops?

Here is what would happen if you averaged the too P/ARR's based on a stock price of $100 which is close to where they are today. Effectively, if CoreWeave had half of the P/ARR today this would give a multiple of x 3.34 on the stock price while reducing NBIS's share price by 1/3.

https://preview.redd.it/ugoj5opy4cof1.png?width=4132&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3f116ec66411ca98debacca0496f03f41dd0d1

This is as of today what the stock price would be if CoreWeave had even close to what NBIS's P/ARR was. Overtime I expect they both settle into a P/ARR and then a P/E of about 15 - 25 if they are still aggressively growing.

If you have anything to add or corrections I will update the model forecasting.

This is not financial advice or advisor.

Remember the NJ Vineland rollout, which Microsoft just contracted to, is for that facility. If someone knows of another one please let me know. As of now, it's phase 1 2025 \~100 MW and phase 2 2026 \~100 MW although it is said can expand up to 300-MW and perhaps there will be great motivation for this. After all, Mark Zuckerberg did say he was putting up GPU tent cities.

The last thing before we get into graphs and figures. You'll begin to question the Microsoft contract for Nebius and how they will actually be able to achieve that without perhaps rolling into capacity handovers to CoreWeave or others just to buy them more time perhaps. Meaning, $17 billion can't possibly be a revenue for Nebius recognized in their quarters for probably 3 years or more.

This would be the major analyst question on upcoming Nebius calls that I want to hear the answer too. 100,200,300 MW isn't going to bring in more than what you are kind of guiding to on the top end of 2026 at 200 MW \~$500 - $700 M quarterly revenues by end of 2026. Surely that is not coming anywhere close in 2025. The contract is through 2031 but if they want to realize more of that revenue now then they are going to have to hurry and build and procure power as fast as humanly possible.

Again, this is a bit of an advantage for CoreWeave because they have so many data centers up and running and so many more coming online even in this year.

**NBIS NJ Vineland rollout and corresponding MSFT contract**

* Phase | Year | MW | Notes
* Phase 1 | 2025 | \~100 | contracted
* Phase 2 | 2026 | \~100 | contracted
* Expandable | Future | up to 300 | site design cap

**Baseline inputs of revenue generated per known MW's**

* Company | Q2 cloud rev | Active MW (Q2) | $/MW/qtr
* CRWV | $1.213B | \~470 | \~$2.58M
* NBIS | $105.1M | \~40–55 (use 50 midpoint) | \~$2.10M (range \~$1.91–2.63M)

So now that we have a normalized Revenue per MW or R / MW now we can analyze our second graph in earnest. For the Year-End-2025 this is where each company would be for their respective MegaWatt online completions.

Simply, CoreWeave is expected / guided to bring online > 900 MW of total power active YE'25 and Nebius is expected to bring on \~100 MW of total power active YE'25.

**YE’25 MW & implied Q4 cloud revenue**

* Company | YE MW target | Low/Mid/High $/MW | Implied Q4 rev
* (CRWV: >900 MW; NBIS: \~100 MW)

https://preview.redd.it/ddmwt45o4cof1.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=969a0198016c211b09af93d70da0a04a7dd3888b

Now what's interesting here is that one has guided to the top and one has low balled to the bottom.

If you use the $1.91 - $2.63M for Nebius you would assume on 100 MW of year-end power they would be at a Q4 revenue projection of $.19B - $.263B and their corresponding guide is $.225-$.275B per quarter. That is right in line and a little higher even for the maxed out scale of 100 MW by ye'25.

On the other hand, CoreWeave has a 22%(top)-40%(bottom) upside on their current ranged guide. So if we're tracking that's a massive whisper number that if they meaningfully bring more than 900 MW online we could see some pretty wild beats on the earnings heading into 2026.

* **CoreWeave:** Our implied **Q4 ≈ $2.32B**/qtr vs. guidance: **Q3 $1.26–$1.30B** and FY’25 **$5.15–$5.35B**, which implies **Q4 need ≈ $1.66–$1.90B**. So our figure is **\~22–40% above** the guidance-implied Q4.
* **Nebius:** Our implied **Q4 ≈ $0.19–$0.26B**/qtr vs. YE’25 **ARR guidance $0.9–$1.1B** (**≈$0.225–$0.275B per quarter**). So our figure is **within or just below** their guided band.

Visually this is what CoreWeave's surprise guides may yield.

https://preview.redd.it/9ieydcgq4cof1.png?width=2223&format=png&auto=webp&s=36683ef74b32c8604fe94c57a2a3057eb79a9362

Look at the comparison between both CoreWeave and NBIS in terms of where they are guiding per predicted active powered capabilities by year-end.

To illustrate the point here are two Q4 predictive sensitivity guides based on increases/decreases in R / MW.

CoreWeave could whisper out to a major upside because they're MW projection for revenue is coming in lowballed. Red is the current guide and black squares are the reasonably expected guide with powered shells coming online.

https://preview.redd.it/pztqi2nt4cof1.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9a9bba8db0c4a99e3b749b21c7c4de473d1b6c1

For Nebius because they've guided so high you only can see an effective top end of their guide range.

https://preview.redd.it/mdnstgcw4cof1.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aa3212d3e485cd3f396d68d13aca4fb9a2a1a04

With all that said, and again with the caveat of CoreWeave is post IPO selling. How is the P/ARR not more normalized. At some point they either all go to \~10 or one raises and the other recedes. The sky is blue and the sun is white; yeah I know.

BUT can CoreWeave not have the luxury of a little more leeway to their P/ARR once the selling stops?

Here is what would happen if you averaged the too P/ARR's based on a stock price of $100 which is close to where they are today. Effectively, if CoreWeave had half of the P/ARR today this would give a multiple of x 3.34 on the stock price while reducing NBIS's share price by 1/3.

https://preview.redd.it/ugoj5opy4cof1.png?width=4132&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3f116ec66411ca98debacca0496f03f41dd0d1

This is as of today what the stock price would be if CoreWeave had even close to what NBIS's P/ARR was. Overtime I expect they both settle into a P/ARR and then a P/E of about 15 - 25 if they are still aggressively growing.

If you have anything to add or corrections I will update the model forecasting.

This is not financial advice or advisor.

I just wrapped up my data engineering internship where I mostly worked with **SQL, Hive, and PySpark** (on-prem setup, no cloud). Now I’m trying to decide which toolset to focus on next for my career, considering the **current job market**.

I see 3 main options:

1. **Microsoft Fabric** → seems to be the future with everything (Data Factory, Synapse, Lakehouse, Power BI) under one hood.
2. **Azure Data Engineering stack (ADF, Synapse, Azure Databricks)** → the “classic” combo I see in most job postings right now.
3. **Just Databricks** → since I already know PySpark, it feels like a natural next step.

My confusion:

* Is **Fabric just a repackaged version of Azure services** or something completely different?
* Should I focus on the **classic Azure DE stack now (ADF + Synapse + Databricks)** since it’s in high demand, and then shift to Fabric later?
* Or would it be smarter to **bet on Fabric early** since MS is clearly pushing it?

Would love to hear from people working in the field — what’s most valuable to learn right now for landing jobs, and what’s the best long-term bet?
