2024-10-05,$AMZN Cargo Train,"I’ve lived in southern Indiana my entire life. If I drive 30 minutes west from my town, I cross 5 railroad crossings. Getting delayed in your travels by a train is just part of life here. Sometimes it’s fun to look at the graffiti and sometimes it makes you want to spit nails. Anyway, you get accustomed to the various types of rail cars you see.

So, I’m stuck waiting on a train for 10 minutes tonight and I see something unusual. It is LOADED with ‘Prime’ shipping containers. I’ve never seen a train loaded with Amazon shipping containers. I confirmed with other people and they haven’t seen them either. Also, these containers appeared to be young/new.

Now, I know this isn’t like spotting Bigfoot or some shit. But, it’s gotta mean something. Either changes in routing for overseas cargo or maybe just using more trains and less semi-trucks to get your wife’s boyfriend’s shit to your house.

I need someone not as smooth brained as I to assess this situation and tell me just how far OTM I need my calls to be. Prime days next week, holiday shopping season shortly thereafter with earnings in between. Think we could see some strong retail numbers and outlook to beat the general soft outlook of this retail season? ",11,19

2024-10-08,Wells Fargo downgrades Amazon on slowing growth expectations & Walmart competition,"Amazon Inc. shares fell on Monday, following a rare analyst downgrade that cited concerns over margin trends into next year, which growth in the cloud computing business is unlikely to compensate for.

Wells Fargo Securities cut the stock to equal weight from overweight, with analyst Ken Gawrelski becoming one of the few analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesn’t have a buy recommendation on the stock. He also cut his price target from $225 to $183, one of the lowest on Wall Street.

2024-10-23,Amazon deny me to put a SES service in production. What??,"Hi

I've created a new ecommerce website to sell educative digital videos made myself related with Roman History. I decided to used AWS for as many services my web required.

So, for WordPress hosting: Lightsail, DNS: Route 53, etc. And for providing an SMTP email service, AWS SES.

I configured SES it and everything works fine in test mode, but to put it in production I have to make a request to AWS to provide information for what I am using this service. I said a normal ecommerce website email use for example, create accounts, confirmation orders and send email to costumer when a new product or offer is available.... And the answer was....

*We reviewed your request and determined that your use of Amazon SES could have a negative impact on our service. We are denying this request to prevent other Amazon SES customers from experiencing interruptions in service.*

No more explanation for security reasons. What negative impact could give a small ecommerce website that sell digital services can provide to Amazon SES?

It's not a big deal, I can look  for another provider, but this thing socks me a lot. Means, none try to make a digital small business, contract a normal email service and for mystery reasons it is denied.

I think we could have an interesting discussion if we share our age (or age range) and the company in which we trust for the rest of our lives (and why).

I’m in my 30s, so assuming I live for the next 50 years, I believe Lockheed Martin ($LMT) will remain an important player in the defense sector, as I expect war (mostly proxy wars) to continue being used for political interests and if the US DoD sees its budget reduced, our current Western society’s paradigm will be over.

Amazon the greatest company in the world. Delivery infrastructure is insane. FedEx and UPS can barely even hire drivers right now. Amazon stole USPS business right from the grubby little hands of FedEx. AWS is top notch. Half of Americans have a prime subscription. New storefront dropping that will compete with Temu prices, at a fraction of the shipping speed. Growing streaming catalog, Thursday Night Football, audiobook and ereader market segmented, exceptional customer service. Bezos keeps his customers happy. He will keep his stockholders happy. He may make his drivers piss in water bottles, but they get paid weekly and at a decent wage, so it’s no worries. Amazon should be the most valuable company in the world.

I have been receiving financial events all this time without any problem, but after 10/30/2024 I am not receiving new FinancialEvents, despite having had multiple sales.

I have already made the requests and although it returns all the FinancialEvents prior to 10/29/2024, I can't see anything from the 30th or 31st, reviewing the docs it mentions that 48 hours may pass, but that deadline has already expired and I still can't see the events.

  
I queried order by order using the API, and it appears that none of my new orders have a FinancialEvent associated with them and that is why I am not receiving anything.

I wanted to know if anyone knows if any changes were made to the API, according to the docs there is nothing new, but everything seems to be fine on my side.

In the past whenever an order was placed almost instantly the FinancialEvent was received.

I have already made the requests and although it returns all the FinancialEvents prior to 10/29/2024, I can't see anything from the 30th or 31st, reviewing the docs it mentions that 48 hours may pass, but that deadline has already expired and I still can't see the events.

  
I queried order by order using the API, and it appears that none of my new orders have a FinancialEvent associated with them and that is why I am not receiving anything.

I wanted to know if anyone knows if any changes were made to the API, according to the docs there is nothing new, but everything seems to be fine on my side.

In the past whenever an order was placed almost instantly the FinancialEvent was received.

2024-11-10,"Stocks that are going to go nuclear, no, literally.","You have seen in recent news that lots of data centers and AI fueled companies are looking for sustainable carbon free energy. That still isn't enough for the likes of amzn, and msft. They need sustainable STABLE energy. Nuclear is the only real option to hit this. Wind and solar energy are not feasible and if we are honest to ourselves, they simply aren't efficient enough. This is why nuclear is needed. 

Many disasters have occured: chernobyl, three mile island, and fukushima to name a few. This has caused the public to have a negative outlook on the technology. Many people believe wrongly that these reactors will destroy the world, when in fact post construction they are some of the safest forms of energy production.

The issue in the past with traditional reactors are that these projects are super fund sites. BILLIONS of dollars, government regulations bloat the cost and balloon the build time. In order to get a new design, the government is the only source. A lengthy billion+ dollar gamble so most build off the last approved design making small improvements. 

Enter SMR's , small modular nuclear reactors. They are extremely small sites in comparison to traditional monstrosities. The safety zone surrounding a SMR set up is limited to the bounds of the actual generator site. This is a big deal because with traditional reactors you have to build out a secured zone 10+ miles around the actual sites perimeter. The costs continuously add up for traditional economies. 

Who is designing SMRS? Tons of people are attempting but it no longer matters. As of 2020, the company NuScale is the only company in the united states with an approved reactor design. Other companies attempting to design and theorize have already gained support from the private industry in most recent history Amazon did so. They are giving money to start ups who are 10+ YEARS behind NuScale in hopes of getting in early.

  
NuScale has lost money year over year but have done amazing at cutting down on costs and bloat reducing their year over year expenses drastically. They have received government assistance already in 2014 (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project), to the tune of 1.4b USD from the DOE which means government relations have already been built. 

They went to deploy and test the reactors by building a 12 module reactor but fear of extra costs and hitting deadlines drove off private investors causing a halt on the project. AND YET NuScale performed relatively well in sustaining its value for a startup that's never made money. They continue to strive for a mid 2025 start to selling and commercializing their product to prove to the world it is safe and possible. I don't really think I need to explain in depth how AI data super centers, mass surveillance, quantum computing, and the general virtualization of everything will continue to drive the demand for stable sustainable energy and how that relates to NuScale.

  
You may ask the following: ""How is this a small risk investment if you're claiming such higher performance?"", ""How are you sure we are going to go nuclear? The coming administration in the US wont be favorable to renewables!"", ""How do you think even if we are it will happen on a short time span?""

  
I have answers. 

  
Even if NuScale goes tits up in debt, has no way of securing contracts, gets beat out my competitors (impossible lol), IT STILL HAS ITS APPROVED DESIGN. That is their (for lack of a better term) trump card. It is worth the 24$ alone depending on who scoops them up to finish the mission. This leads me into the second nuclear stock. To supply this industry uranium will be needed. The government has been looking for a domestic supplier of fuel grade uranium that is ready for enrichment. Sadly, the enrichment game is mostly private holdings can't get in on that public goodness. But Uranium Energy Corp. has been making money moves, aquiring LIQUIDATABLE uranium and hodling it as hard as they can. Increasing mining, storage, and infrastructure capacities. They are ready for the next move. The united states is already trying to bid on BOTH A GenIII+ nuclear reactor(https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program), as well as a domestic supplier and enricher of fuel grade uranium(https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and) <-- they have one for Low enriched as well.

The government is cheap and wants to save money. They have made a report investigating the savings made per killowat compared to the incentives given. They found they gave out 50+ billions and made jack shit return. They equated to do the same garbage return rate they'd only have to use 10 billion for the SMR tech coming out if they support the role out. 

Even with trump in office these stocks make sense to invest in for both hodling potential and short term options gamba. The government is already in favor of this, they will do whatever they need to change the public perception Hell, they don't even care., They will executive order whatever they need.  The following are reasons a trump office will help nuclear.

He has already stated that he will slash 4 or however many regulations per passed regulation. This will benefit all industries regardless of how you feel about it on an emotional level. Furthermore he wants a stronger American offense and defense. Putting SMRs into most states after commercial shows its viability will make for an invasion insurance, solar flare insurance, EMP insurance, supernova insurance, etc. SMRs are off grid capable. They can provide direct power hence the stability for data centers. If the grid goes down SMR's keep pumping. The steam they produce in the next generation will be more efficiently harvested for chemical manufacturing of ammonia and other reagents.

Even with a strong want to continue using fossil fuels for trump, all the fossil fuel industries benefit. With the minimal space requirements needed essentially anywhere near any industry center a nuclear reactor could be built. And on the same page, lets talk about the building of this reactor(s) and its module(s).

  
It is a modular system and NuScale has already put thought and money into fabrication plants to create the modular components, as well as invested in what they call E2 centers across the globe to train professionals to work at NuScale reactor sites. They aren't a tech bullshit startup with false promises they are actively confident and preparing for a 3 year explosion into the industry. They have made talks and contracts and centers in eastern europe namely romania, they have done the same in the middle east, they have done the same in africa specifically full blown university support from Ghana(https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/). This shit is happening but retail regards still have their head in the sand. I think the big boys are waiting to blow this shit up over night in the coming few years.

  
I bought in at 22 something and it hit almost 26 the other day. UEC is a bit more volatile but in the exact same boat. This isnt a source of uncorrelated returns, these markets are both going online. And if tariffs happen, these people are MOONING. The signs are right in our faces.

FINAL KEY POINTS AND WRAP UP FOR THE TLDREGARDS:



\*\*Nuclear energy is happening short term and already has DOE support.

\*\*\*ONLY ENTITY THAT HAS AN APPROVED SMR DESIGN BY THE NUKE COMITEE IN THE US\*\*\*

\*\*TRUMP SLASHING REGS ++ TARIFFS??\*\*

2024-11-13,"Stocks that are going to go nuclear, no, literally.","You have seen in recent news that lots of data centers and AI fueled companies are looking for sustainable carbon free energy. That still isn't enough for the likes of amzn, and msft. They need sustainable STABLE energy. Nuclear is the only real option to hit this. Wind and solar energy are not feasible and if we are honest to ourselves, they simply aren't efficient enough. This is why nuclear is needed. 

Many disasters have occured: chernobyl, three mile island, and fukushima to name a few. This has caused the public to have a negative outlook on the technology. Many people believe wrongly that these reactors will destroy the world, when in fact post construction they are some of the safest forms of energy production.

The issue in the past with traditional reactors are that these projects are super fund sites. BILLIONS of dollars, government regulations bloat the cost and balloon the build time. In order to get a new design, the government is the only source. A lengthy billion+ dollar gamble so most build off the last approved design making small improvements. 

Enter SMR's , small modular nuclear reactors. They are extremely small sites in comparison to traditional monstrosities. The safety zone surrounding a SMR set up is limited to the bounds of the actual generator site. This is a big deal because with traditional reactors you have to build out a secured zone 10+ miles around the actual sites perimeter. The costs continuously add up for traditional economies. 

Who is designing SMRS? Tons of people are attempting but it no longer matters. As of 2020, the company NuScale is the only company in the united states with an approved reactor design. Other companies attempting to design and theorize have already gained support from the private industry in most recent history Amazon did so. They are giving money to start ups who are 10+ YEARS behind NuScale in hopes of getting in early.

  
NuScale has lost money year over year but have done amazing at cutting down on costs and bloat reducing their year over year expenses drastically. They have received government assistance already in 2014 (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project), to the tune of 1.4b USD from the DOE which means government relations have already been built. 

They went to deploy and test the reactors by building a 12 module reactor but fear of extra costs and hitting deadlines drove off private investors causing a halt on the project. AND YET NuScale performed relatively well in sustaining its value for a startup that's never made money. They continue to strive for a mid 2025 start to selling and commercializing their product to prove to the world it is safe and possible. I don't really think I need to explain in depth how AI data super centers, mass surveillance, quantum computing, and the general virtualization of everything will continue to drive the demand for stable sustainable energy and how that relates to NuScale.

  
You may ask the following: ""How is this a small risk investment if you're claiming such higher performance?"", ""How are you sure we are going to go nuclear? The coming administration in the US wont be favorable to renewables!"", ""How do you think even if we are it will happen on a short time span?""

  
I have answers. 

  
Even if NuScale goes tits up in debt, has no way of securing contracts, gets beat out my competitors (impossible lol), IT STILL HAS ITS APPROVED DESIGN. That is their (for lack of a better term) trump card. It is worth the 24$ alone depending on who scoops them up to finish the mission. This leads me into the second nuclear stock. To supply this industry uranium will be needed. The government has been looking for a domestic supplier of fuel grade uranium that is ready for enrichment. Sadly, the enrichment game is mostly private holdings can't get in on that public goodness. But Uranium Energy Corp. has been making money moves, aquiring LIQUIDATABLE uranium and hodling it as hard as they can. Increasing mining, storage, and infrastructure capacities. They are ready for the next move. The united states is already trying to bid on BOTH A GenIII+ nuclear reactor(https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program), as well as a domestic supplier and enricher of fuel grade uranium(https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and) <-- they have one for Low enriched as well.

The government is cheap and wants to save money. They have made a report investigating the savings made per killowat compared to the incentives given. They found they gave out 50+ billions and made jack shit return. They equated to do the same garbage return rate they'd only have to use 10 billion for the SMR tech coming out if they support the role out. 

Even with trump in office these stocks make sense to invest in for both hodling potential and short term options gamba. The government is already in favor of this, they will do whatever they need to change the public perception Hell, they don't even care., They will executive order whatever they need.  The following are reasons a trump office will help nuclear.

He has already stated that he will slash 4 or however many regulations per passed regulation. This will benefit all industries regardless of how you feel about it on an emotional level. Furthermore he wants a stronger American offense and defense. Putting SMRs into most states after commercial shows its viability will make for an invasion insurance, solar flare insurance, EMP insurance, supernova insurance, etc. SMRs are off grid capable. They can provide direct power hence the stability for data centers. If the grid goes down SMR's keep pumping. The steam they produce in the next generation will be more efficiently harvested for chemical manufacturing of ammonia and other reagents.

Even with a strong want to continue using fossil fuels for trump, all the fossil fuel industries benefit. With the minimal space requirements needed essentially anywhere near any industry center a nuclear reactor could be built. And on the same page, lets talk about the building of this reactor(s) and its module(s).

  
It is a modular system and NuScale has already put thought and money into fabrication plants to create the modular components, as well as invested in what they call E2 centers across the globe to train professionals to work at NuScale reactor sites. They aren't a tech bullshit startup with false promises they are actively confident and preparing for a 3 year explosion into the industry. They have made talks and contracts and centers in eastern europe namely romania, they have done the same in the middle east, they have done the same in africa specifically full blown university support from Ghana(https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/). This shit is happening but retail regards still have their head in the sand. I think the big boys are waiting to blow this shit up over night in the coming few years.

  
I bought in at 22 something and it hit almost 26 the other day. UEC is a bit more volatile but in the exact same boat. This isnt a source of uncorrelated returns, these markets are both going online. And if tariffs happen, these people are MOONING. The signs are right in our faces.

FINAL KEY POINTS AND WRAP UP FOR THE TLDREGARDS:



\*\*Nuclear energy is happening short term and already has DOE support.

\*\*\*ONLY ENTITY THAT HAS AN APPROVED SMR DESIGN BY THE NUKE COMITEE IN THE US\*\*\*

2024-11-21,$RIVN: Riding to Valhalla,"Alright, degenerates. Rivian isn’t just the dorky little brother of Tesla anymore—it’s the ex-nerd who’s going to show up at the 10-year reunion ripped and in a tux, ready to steal the prom queen. This play has all the makings of a **10x banger** if you’re willing to hold on like your life depends on it. Buckle up, because this ride is going 0 to 69 faster than you can swipe right.

## Why Rivian Is About to Deliver

**Tesla’s Fumbling the Ball** 

Elon’s gone off the deep end and is alienating the very crowd that made EVs sexy to begin with. Progressive elites? Millennials? The kinds of people who buy organic kale and want their car to save the planet? Yeah, they’re turning the corner to RIVN, who’s out here whispering sweet nothings about sustainability, inclusivity, and not being a hot mess. Basically, Tesla’s stuck doing the walk of shame while Rivian’s already at brunch ordering mimosas.

**How Rivian Could Ride Trump’s EV Rollercoaster**

You’d think Trump and EVs go together like oil and water, but here’s the twist: RIVN could totally benefit from his likely “America First” policies. With Rivian’s production fully based in the U.S., any federal push for domestic manufacturing would be a tailwind. Meanwhile, Trump’s cozy relationship with Elon might have TSLA in the spotlight, but every infrastructure boost for Tesla chargers indirectly benefits RIVN since its vehicles now play nice with Tesla's Supercharger network. Most any other policy that benefits TSLA will help RIVN as well. Rivian’s set to snag the benefits without the baggage, making it the sneaky winner here. Everyone’s FOMOing into TSLA right now, but RIVN is the sleeper play here, and it’s only a matter of time until the market realizes this.

**New Models That’ll Make You Feel Things** 

Let’s talk about Rivian’s R2 SUV and its new lineup. Starting at $45K, it’s the hot-but-affordable option that’s ready to steal hearts (and market share). Tri-motor setup? Level 3 autonomy? Integration with Tesla’s Supercharger network? That’s not just sexy—that’s full-blown EV porn. This isn’t a one-night stand; Rivian’s building long-term market appeal. And if that $45k price tag isn’t inclusive enough for you Wendy’s employees, they’re adding a cheaper R3 model just for you (dumpster price point model still TBD).

**Efficiency: More Bang for Their Buck** 

Sure, Rivian’s been burning through cash faster than you can dump your paycheck into hookers and blow, but they’ve learned to keep it tight. Cutting the Georgia plant saved $2.25B, and now they’ve found [a sugar daddy in Volkswagen to the tune of $5 billion](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/rivian-volkswagen-production-forecast.html), exactly what they need to hold them over until their new models roll out. That’s efficiency, baby.

**Analysts Are Hot for RIVN**

 Some of the suits on Wall Street are swooning over Rivian. Their buy rating and price target of $15.67 give it a potential upside of 54%. They’re hyped about Rivian’s leaner operations, aggressive production targets, and a fat pipeline of new EVs. But there are still plenty of doubters who like losing money: [a short interest of 18%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rivn) means the minute this stock turns around, the squeeze will make it run.

RIVN shot from current levels all the way to $18 when the VW news first dropped, plus the recent pop to $12 when VW upped their commitment from $5B to $5.8B, but they’re now being valued the same as they were before the deal existed. People who think a cash injection of half the company’s market cap isn’t going to move the needle are delusional. Not to mention they have $6.73B cash on hand, and they’re only valued at $10B? Seems like a steal to me.

## The Risks (Nothing to See Here)

**Dilution** 

Rivian’s diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R&D and scaling production, which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW’s cash infusion (with potentially more in the future?) and affordable models on the horizon, they might not need to rely on dilution going forward.

**Cash Burn**

Rivian’s like the guy spending money he doesn’t have to impress his date. Sure, it’s a gamble, but if those new models hit like I think they will, it’s a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House, do you honestly think he’s going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that’s all he talks about? Hell no, he’ll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off.

## TL;DR: 

RIVN isn’t just another EV play—it’s *the EV play* for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game, Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman, and Rivian’s lineup of models hotter than a summer fling, the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50% upside, with room to double. This stock’s the real deal, and I’m strapping in for the ride.

And if I haven’t sold you on it, take it instead from this guy who turned $182k into $11.7 million:

## The Risks (Nothing to See Here)

**Dilution** 

Rivian’s diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R&D and scaling production, which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW’s cash infusion (with potentially more in the future?) and affordable models on the horizon, they might not need to rely on dilution going forward.

**Cash Burn**

Rivian’s like the guy spending money he doesn’t have to impress his date. Sure, it’s a gamble, but if those new models hit like I think they will, it’s a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House, do you honestly think he’s going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that’s all he talks about? Hell no, he’ll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off.

## TL;DR: 

RIVN isn’t just another EV play—it’s *the EV play* for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game, Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman, and Rivian’s lineup of models hotter than a summer fling, the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50% upside, with room to double. This stock’s the real deal, and I’m strapping in for the ride.

And if I haven’t sold you on it, take it instead from this guy who turned $182k into $11.7 million:

Position: $35k in shares, 20 $35 Jan 2026 calls, 10 $20 Jan 2027 calls

2024-12-01,Can't reach site from Linux servers,"I'm having trouble connecting to a website from our Linux servers. I've tried from a couple different Linux servers, Debian and Ubuntu, but I can't seem to curl the site. It works fine locally on my Macbook Pro however.

I'm guessing it might have to do with Amazons certificate update but I'm not sure.

2024-12-04,Should I Use Tax Loss Harvesting to Dilute My Amazon Holdings?,"Hello everyone,

My portfolio is currently split 50/50 between Amazon stock (from RSUs that vested over five years ago) and a mix of high-growth ETFs and total market ETFs. I’ve been considering reducing my position in Amazon, but I’ve been hesitant due to the 15% capital gains tax.

Earlier this year, I sold some losing positions in stocks I had held for over three years, resulting in a loss of around $100k. I’m now wondering if it’s a good idea to offset these losses with gains from selling some Amazon shares, leaving me with a net loss of $3k to claim on my 2024 taxes.

Since retirement is over 25 years away, my plan is to reinvest in high-growth ETFs like QQQ or VUG. While these ETFs still have a significant exposure to Amazon, they would provide more diversification than my current concentrated position.

Does this strategy make sense? Are there any other factors I should consider before proceeding? I’d appreciate your advice!",15,10

2024-12-16,2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways.

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~24% and \~16%.",839,182
2024-12-17,2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

# Realized (sold) in 2024

* **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):** \-18.69% (\*)
* **Amazon (AMZN):** \+97.41%
* **Alphabet/Google (GOOGL):** \+75.05%
* **Apple (AAPL):** \+8.77% (\*)

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

Amazon isn’t just an e-commerce giant; it’s an ecosystem with diverse revenue streams that touch nearly every part of our lives. From its robust retail operations and cloud computing powerhouse AWS to its advertising business, device sales, and subscription services like Prime, Amazon has mastered the art of innovation and scale.

One of my favorite aspects is Amazon Prime, a service that bundles so much value into one membership. Beyond free shipping, Prime offers access to Prime Video, music streaming, exclusive deals, and more—making it a must-have for millions of households globally.

A recent highlight from Prime Video is its record-breaking performance in NFL streaming. The Steelers-Ravens playoff game brought in an impressive 22.07 million average viewers, setting a new high for Amazon’s sports streaming efforts. While this figure lags behind Netflix’s Christmas Day NFL stream and traditional broadcasters like Fox and CBS for other playoff games, it’s a significant milestone. More importantly, Amazon’s partnership with the NFL is driving Prime subscriptions and ad revenue. Their Thursday Night Football viewership grew 13% year-over-year in 2024, showcasing their ability to compete in the fiercely contested live sports space.

Looking ahead, this is just the beginning for Amazon. With its unique ability to blend commerce, media, and technology, their continued investment in live sports and other high-impact content will be transformative—not just for Prime Video but for the entire ecosystem.

It doesn't do anything I ask it to. It takes up extra space in the AWS Management Console, and adds an unnecessary button to invoke it. This just creates cruft in the UI, and serves no other purpose. It reminds me of ""clippy"" from the old Microsoft Office days.

Please remove Amazon Q from the AWS Management Console.",444,61

validation done in Go and Rust

Hey!  
I'm setting up OIDC authentication (not for cognito) using ALB but I'm struggling to validate the ""x-amzn-oidc-data"" token in Rust.  
I've followed the documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html) and [here](https://aws.amazon.com/it/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/security-best-practices-when-using-alb-authentication/). But I'm always getting ""Invalid padding"" error.

```

    let pem_doc = parse_pem(pem_str)?;
    if pem_doc.tag() != ""PUBLIC KEY"" && pem_doc.tag() != ""EC PUBLIC KEY"" {
        return Err(""Not an EC public key PEM"".into());
    }
    Ok(pem_doc.contents().to_vec())
}

        kid,
    );
    let response = reqwest::blocking::get(&url)?.text()?;
    println!(""{:?}"", response);
    Ok(response)
}

I am facing an issue with changes in the inode values of the file `/boot/efi/EFI/amzn/grub.cfg`.

I use Wazuh to monitor the internal files of the VM, and every day at the same early morning time, it alerts that the inode value of the `grub.cfg` file has changed. Its checksum and content remain the same; only the inode changes (this is not a false positive from Wazuh).

I have exhaustively checked logs and the kernel but found nothing that indicates something is causing the file to change. Using the `stat` command, the last access or modification dates of the file also do not change.

In the AWS logs, nothing was found that could have been executed at the specified time or in the directory where the file is located.

I would appreciate some help, as even after researching, I haven't found anything similar to my case.

My scenario is as follows:
- Instance type: t3.small
- OS: Amazon Linux 2023.6.20250123",2,1

I’m committed to following best practices and keeping my domain’s reputation clean. I’d really appreciate it if you could reconsider my request for production access. Let me know if you need any more details!

2025-04-10,Amazon cancels some inventory orders from China after tariffs,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-cancels-inventory-orders-china-142849013.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-cancels-inventory-orders-china-142849013.html)

(Bloomberg) — [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) has canceled orders for multiple products made in China and other Asian countries, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter, suggesting the company is reducing its exposure to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.

The orders for beach chairs, scooters, air conditioners and other merchandise from multiple Amazon vendors were halted after Trump’s April 2 announcement that he planned to levy tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, the people said. The timing of the cancellations, which had no warning, led the vendors to suspect it was a response to tariffs.

An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. The company identified international trade disputes as a risk factor in its annual report released in February. “China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods,” the company said.

It’s unclear how widespread the cancellations are and how many types of merchandise they affect.

One vendor who has been selling beach chairs made in China to Amazon for more than a decade received an email from the company last week that said it was canceling some purchase orders it placed “in error“ and instructed the vendor not to ship them. The email, which was reviewed by Bloomberg, didn’t mention tariffs.

The vendor said the $500,000 wholesale order was nixed after the chairs had already been manufactured, leaving this person on the hook to pay the factory and find other buyers. The vendor, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from Amazon, said the company had never canceled one of its orders in such as manner.

Scott Miller, a former Amazon vendor manager who now works as an e-commerce consultant, said Amazon canceled orders for merchandise made in China and other Asian countries from several of his clients. The cancellations came without warning, he said, and could force vendors to renegotiate terms with the e-commerce company.

“Amazon really holds all of the cards,” said Miller, founder and CEO of pdPlus in Minneapolis. “The only real recourse vendors have is to either sell this inventory in other countries at lower margins or try to work with other retailers.”

The beach chair vendor and Miller said Amazon cancelled “direct import orders,” a process in which Amazon buys inventory wholesale in the country in which it is made and ships the products to its warehouses in the United States. Amazon serves as the importer of record for the orders, which means it pays tariffs when the products reach US ports.

Amazon has been importing items this way for years as a way to reduce costs since Amazon can often use bulk shipping rates to import items at lower costs than vendors. Canceling those orders puts the tariff exposure back on vendors if they import merchandise to the US by other means.

Items Amazon buys directly from vendors account for about 40% of the products sold on its website. The rest of the company’s sales are made by independent merchants who essentially rent digital shelf space from Amazon, paying the company commissions and fees for logistics and advertising.

Trump’s tariffs have rattled global markets. Many businesses are raising prices, stoking fears of a recession. On Tuesday, Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc. reduced its 2025 revenue forecast for Amazon, citing the effects of tariffs in a research note. The company’s shares have fallen about 21% this year, compared with the S&P 500’s 15% slump.",29,7

**Amazon to display tariff costs for consumers**

Amazon doesn’t want to shoulder the blame for the cost of President Donald Trump’s trade war.

So the e-commerce giant will soon show how much Trump’s tariffs are adding to the price of each product, according to a person familiar with the plan.

The shopping site will display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs – right next to the product’s total listed price.

2025-05-02,This is why I'm getting AMZN calls for earnings,"Guys! It's finally happening. Amazon is releasing their earnings today. The stock moved down last earnings, up the one prior, down the one before that, up before that. It's been kinda bouncing back and forth. So you might think I'm uncertain this time around, but I'm not. [Link to my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kbnosv/everything_about_metas_earnings_tonight/) on META. [Link to my RDDT post for today's earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kcgypg/why_im_getting_calls_for_rddts_earnings_today/). Now that I've established my track record, let's get into it. 

Right now it’s all about tariffs, of course. Has anyone read the recent report that suggested the company might start showing tariff costs on product listings? That resulted in a phone call from Trump to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Predictably, Amazon afterwards denied the claim, stating the proposal was “never approved” and that displaying tariff costs “is not going to happen.” Lmao.

Still, questions linger. [Loop Capital’s Rob Sanderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-sanderson-7b049947/), a 5-star analyst ranked among the top 4% of Wall Street pros, notes it’s unclear how Amazon will deal with all this recent tariff bs. According to management, though, the likely scenario is straightforward: third-party sellers will simply pass on the higher costs to customers.

That, says Sanderson, will have “some elasticity impact on demand but is GMV accretive on a unit basis.” In any case, while it remains to be seen how the company will manage Chinese supply for 1P sales and “how quickly it passes through price increases,” he thinks it is “only a transitory risk at worst.”

Tariff chaos aside, as for what to expect from the readout, Sanderson believes the consumer environment in Q1 remained sluggish but largely in line with expectations, and that Amazon performed well under the circumstances. The Department of Commerce’s proxy for e-commerce (non-store retailer sales) grew 4.2% in Q1, with growth accelerating each month and reaching 6.1% in March. The truth is, retail stores are dying and companies like amazon are picking up the slack. [Online shopping will be a majority of all shopping very soon.](https://optinmonster.com/online-shopping-statistics/) And because of this, AMZN is one of my longer share holds.  

Going back to what the analyst was saying specifically in regards to today's earnings: “This bodes well for 1Q results if directionally correct with management providing guidance off the weakest month of the quarter."" He also thinks these trends have mostly carried into April and that tariff-related volatility has not yet had a significant impact on consumer spending.

As industry checks across cloud service providers (CSPs) indicate sustained positive momentum despite broader macro uncertainty, I believe AWS will deliver solid results today. The consensus margin estimate of 35.7% (a 190 basis point year-over-year decline) could turn out to be conservative, even when accounting for increased CapEx and a revenue mix shift toward generative AI, which I assume comes with lower margins.

This is taking place against a backdrop where the digitization of workflows has become a top priority for execs globally, driven by the rise of generative AI. While mainstream IT use cases for AI are still taking shape, there is an “abundance of demand” from early adopters, and even slower-moving companies are accelerating their cloud migration efforts. As budgets are already funded, Sanderson doesn’t expect significant budget changes unless companies face major spending cuts.

Did anyone see the Google results last week? I did a post on GOOG as well. Their results reinforce this view with strong growth at GCP and commentary on capacity shortages and inability to meet current demand.

Bottom line, ahead of earnings, Sanderson maintained a Buy rating on AMZN shares, while his $285 price target factors in a 12-month gain of ~50%. ([Sanderson’s track record](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/rob-sanderson)) Like I said, I have shares as a long term hold.

Are there hidden geo-restrictions on this service?  The user is trying to access a VDI on us east coast from Uruguay.  I can get right in from my home computers.  User is using a recent-ish Ubuntu on an old laptop.  Is there any logging available to the administrator?  I believe it's wide open to the world by default - am I wrong?

Do these VDI's bind to the first IP address that connects to them and then refuse others?  I'm just trying to figure out why my user can't connect.  I tried this VDI from here first which is what leads me to ask that.

I'd open a ticket with Amazon that their stuff don't work but they want $200.

The tariffs are of course bad for the retail side but it seems every quarter more and more of profits and revenue are coming from AWS all this AI is going to need data centers and hosting.  I picked $240 because that's just under the 52 week high.  I suppose maybe $230 would be safer but with AWS growing the way it is setting a new all time high in the next 2 years should happen.  If I get assigned above 200 I'll just sell a 2 week ATM or slightly OTM call and close out the position that way.  Shoved the entire premium into TBIL so the interest on that will should help magnify gains and offset some of the losses if I'm wrong.  I'm thinking if tariffs do stay at a blanket 10% Amazon will raise prices and 3rd party sellers will raise prices so profit margin will stay the same but revenue will be slightly inflated. ,0,9

If I get assigned above 200 I'll just sell a 2 week ATM or slightly OTM call and close out the position that way.  Shoved the entire premium into TBIL so the interest on that will should help magnify gains and offset some of the losses if I'm wrong.  I'm thinking if tariffs do stay at a blanket 10% Amazon will raise prices and 3rd party sellers will raise prices so profit margin will stay the same but revenue will be slightly inflated. ,0,9

2025-07-04,Why Are My Amazon Bedrock Quotas So Low and Not Adjustable?,"https://preview.redd.it/j2xkb7n3rqaf1.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=77d5c98a14ca871477f533d8ae52a993d10c6db5

  
I'm hoping someone from the AWS community can help shed light on this situation or suggest a solution.

# My Situation

* **My Bedrock quotas for Claude Sonnet 4 and other models are extremely low (some set to zero or one request per minute).**
* **None of these quotas are adjustable** in the Service Quotas console—they’re all marked as ""Not adjustable.""
* I’ve attached a screenshot showing the current state of my quotas.
* I opened a support case with AWS **over 50 days ago** and have yet to receive any meaningful response or resolution.

# What I’ve Tried

* Submitted a detailed support case with all required documentation and business justification.
* Double-checked the Service Quotas console and AWS documentation.
* Searched for any notifications or emails from AWS about quota changes—found nothing.
* Reached out to AWS support multiple times for updates.

# Impact

* My development workflow is severely impacted. I can’t use Bedrock for my personal projects as planned.
* Even basic usage is impossible due to these restrictive limits.
* The quotas are not only low, but the fact that they’re not adjustable means I can’t even request an increase through the normal channels.

# What I’ve Found from the Community

* **Others are experiencing the same issue:** There are multiple reports of Bedrock quotas being suddenly reduced to unusable levels, sometimes even set to zero, with no warning or explanation from AWS.
* **No clear solution:** Some users have had support manually adjust quotas after repeated requests, but many are still waiting for answers or have been told to just keep submitting tickets.
* **Possible reasons:** AWS may be doing this for new accounts, for certain regions, or due to high demand and resource management policies. But there’s no official communication or guidance on how to resolve it.

# My Questions for the Community

* **Has anyone successfully resolved this issue?** If so, how?
* Is there a way to escalate support cases for quota increases when the quotas are not adjustable?
* Are there alternative approaches or workarounds while waiting for AWS to respond?
* Is this a temporary situation, or should I expect these quotas to remain this low indefinitely?

Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. This is incredibly frustrating, especially given the lack of communication from AWS and the impact on my work.

Thanks in advance for any help or insight!",15,14
2025-07-04,Amazon blocked my account and I'll lose all my certifications and vouchers,"Something bizarre happened to me in the past couple of days. Sharing to alert others and to ask if someone has been through the same.

I wanted to enroll to a new AWS certification, I already hold a few of them. However, I can't login into my Amazon account that holds all my certifications anymore, since I don't have access to the phone number anymore to which my MFA for that account is linked (I know I should have setup multiple other MFAs, but sadly didn't). After a few failed attempts, Amazon blocked my account.

Now, after multiple calls with them, they say they can't help me unblock the account since I don't have any active orders linked to the account placed in the last year. Which is completely bizarre, considering all the amount of money in certifications spent with that account, that don't account for nothing on their side. How is it possible that they don't have a business rule to check if there are certifications linked to the account, before taking such a drastic stance regarding the unblocking of the account?

After multiple calls, they're telling me straight there's absolutely nothing they can do about it, and the only solution is to hard delete the current account, and create a new one with same e-mail. And that will actually delete all my previous certifications and vouchers, ""sorry, there's nothing we can do about it"". 

I'm not even sure I'll be able to enroll to a new certification without proof of the previous ones. All I have are the e-mails in the past confirming I got approved into the certifications, but will that be enough? They can't even confirm that to me.

Just wanted to share this situation and ask if someone else went through the same and was able to solve it differently, before I pull the switch to hard delete my account. Quite disappointed on Amazon regarding this one, the lack of solutions and lack of effort to at least try to move my certification to my new account is disappointing to say the least.",26,17

2025-07-05,Why Are My Amazon Bedrock Quotas So Low and Not Adjustable?,"https://preview.redd.it/j2xkb7n3rqaf1.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=77d5c98a14ca871477f533d8ae52a993d10c6db5

  
I'm hoping someone from the AWS community can help shed light on this situation or suggest a solution.

# My Situation

* **My Bedrock quotas for Claude Sonnet 4 and other models are extremely low (some set to zero or one request per minute).**
* **None of these quotas are adjustable** in the Service Quotas console—they’re all marked as ""Not adjustable.""
* I’ve attached a screenshot showing the current state of my quotas.
* I opened a support case with AWS **over 50 days ago** and have yet to receive any meaningful response or resolution.

# What I’ve Tried

* Submitted a detailed support case with all required documentation and business justification.
* Double-checked the Service Quotas console and AWS documentation.
* Searched for any notifications or emails from AWS about quota changes—found nothing.
* Reached out to AWS support multiple times for updates.

# Impact

* My development workflow is severely impacted. I can’t use Bedrock for my personal projects as planned.
* Even basic usage is impossible due to these restrictive limits.
* The quotas are not only low, but the fact that they’re not adjustable means I can’t even request an increase through the normal channels.

# What I’ve Found from the Community

* **Others are experiencing the same issue:** There are multiple reports of Bedrock quotas being suddenly reduced to unusable levels, sometimes even set to zero, with no warning or explanation from AWS.
* **No clear solution:** Some users have had support manually adjust quotas after repeated requests, but many are still waiting for answers or have been told to just keep submitting tickets.
* **Possible reasons:** AWS may be doing this for new accounts, for certain regions, or due to high demand and resource management policies. But there’s no official communication or guidance on how to resolve it.

# My Questions for the Community

* **Has anyone successfully resolved this issue?** If so, how?
* Is there a way to escalate support cases for quota increases when the quotas are not adjustable?
* Are there alternative approaches or workarounds while waiting for AWS to respond?
* Is this a temporary situation, or should I expect these quotas to remain this low indefinitely?

Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. This is incredibly frustrating, especially given the lack of communication from AWS and the impact on my work.

Thanks in advance for any help or insight!",15,14

2025-07-08,"We built an email sending platform on top of Amazon SES. Now, with STS & CouldFormation setup, thanks to your feedback","Hey Everyone,

About 8 months ago, I shared [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1ge7n7p/i_built_an_email_sending_platform_on_top_of_aws/) about [bluefox.email](https://bluefox.email/for/amazon-ses-users), a ""bring your own SES"" email sending platform. I got a lot of feedback from you, and the two most important ones are:

 \- that it should connect to your SES via STS, not Access Keys. Totally valid point, that's the secure way!

 \- and that a CloudFormation script would help a lot with setting everything up. Again, I could not agree more!

We finally rolled out these two things. (I know, that it took a LOT of time, but we needed to finalize quite a lot of things for customers first.)

  
Now, it's ridiculously quick and easy to get started!!! (Given that you have production access to SES...)

Thanks for the advice everyone!

We would appreciate a second round of a friendly roast, if you have some time to try it out.

2025-07-14,"Prime Day 2025 U.S. retailers drove $24.1 billion in online spend, up 30.3% from 2024, according to new data from Adobe","July 12 (Reuters) - Online spending soared $24.1 billion across U.S. retailers during the stretch from July 8 to 11 – dubbed ""Black Friday in Summer"", outpacing Adobe Analytics' prior forecast, as eager shoppers rushed to snap up deep discounts on back-to-school essentials.  
  
Retailers recorded online sales growth of 30.3% during events that included Amazon Prime Day, Adobe said on Saturday, compared with [its projections of ](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-set-lift-us-online-sales-238-billion-adobe-estimates-2025-07-07/)28.4%.

Online retail sales in the U.S. rose 11% to [$14.2 billion a year ago](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-boosts-us-online-sales-142-bln-adobe-says-2024-07-18/).The Prime Day event has also been cemented as a ""back-to-school"" shopping moment, as consumers jumped on early deals to stock up on essentials and get ahead of the back-to-school rush, Adobe said.

Several major retailers including e-commerce giant [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) [(AMZN.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AMZN.O), Walmart [(WMT.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/WMT.N), Target [(TGT.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TGT.N) as well as Best Buy [(BBY.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/BBY.N) have been launching deal events with strong discounts, encouraging shoppers to trade up on expensive items they might normally pass on.

[Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) extended its sales window to 96 hours, up from the typical 48, featuring aggressive promotions on categories ranging from apparel to electronics.

A wave of enticing deals comes at a time when heightened trade tensions amid the Trump administration's volatile tariff policies have rattled consumers and businesses, and as the new August 1 deadline for countries to renegotiate trade agreements with the United States looms.

According to the report, shopping on mobile was the dominant transaction channel during the Prime Day event, driving 53.2% of online sales, above Adobe's forecast of 52.5%.

According to Adobe, overall discounts across U.S. retailers were between 11% and 24%, compared with the prior forecast range of 10% to 24%.Apparel had the biggest deals at 24%, compared with 20% last year, while electronics were at 23%, similar to last year.

2025-07-21,Hands-On with Amazon S3 Vectors (Preview) + Bedrock Knowledge Bases: A Serverless RAG Demo,"Amazon recently introduced [S3 Vectors (Preview)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/vectors/) : native vector storage and similarity search support within Amazon S3. It allows storing, indexing, and querying high-dimensional vectors without managing dedicated infrastructure.

[From AWS Blog](https://preview.redd.it/odag5ge2w5ef1.png?width=2190&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7672b78de2512ba0fc155930f84b81062e45f07)

To evaluate its capabilities, I built a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that integrates:

* **Amazon S3 Vectors**
* **Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases** to orchestrate chunking, embedding (via Titan), and retrieval
* **AWS Lambda + API Gateway** for exposing a API endpoint
* A document use case (Bedrock FAQ PDF) for retrieval

**Motivation and Context**

Building RAG workflows traditionally requires setting up vector databases (e.g., FAISS, OpenSearch, Pinecone), managing compute (EC2, containers), and manually integrating with LLMs. This adds cost and operational complexity.

With the new setup:

* No servers
* No vector DB provisioning
* Fully managed document ingestion and embedding
* Pay-per-use query and storage pricing

Ideal for teams looking to experiment or deploy cost-efficient semantic search or RAG use cases with minimal DevOps.

**Architecture Overview**

The pipeline works as follows:

1. Upload source PDF to S3
2. Create a Bedrock Knowledge Base → it chunks, embeds, and stores into a new S3 Vector bucket
3. Client calls API Gateway with a query
4. Lambda triggers `retrieveAndGenerate` using the Bedrock runtime
5. Bedrock retrieves top-k relevant chunks and generates the answer using Nova (or other LLM)
6. Response returned to the client

[Architecture diagram of the Demo which i tried](https://preview.redd.it/gu6d3ys9v5ef1.jpg?width=1587&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=938818633c0a96fe122a6ec35e388421922b0474)

**More on AWS S3 Vectors**

* **Native vector storage and indexing** within S3
* **No provisioning required** — inherits S3’s scalability
* Supports **metadata filters** for hybrid search scenarios
* Pricing is **storage + query-based**, e.g.:
   * $0.06/GB/month for vector + metadata
   * $0.0025 per 1,000 queries
* Designed for **low-cost, high-scale, non-latency-critical use cases**
* Preview available in few regions

[From AWS Blog](https://preview.redd.it/9cgpwc4gv5ef1.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf81662551de771ca88ffc880a1580c4ddfb1274)

The simplicity of S3 + Bedrock makes it a strong option for batch document use cases, enterprise RAG, and grounding internal LLM agents.

**Cost Insights**

Sample pricing for \~10M vectors:

* Storage: \~59 GB → $3.54/month
* Upload (PUT): \~$1.97/month
* 1M queries: \~$5.87/month
* Total: **\~$11.38/month**

This is significantly cheaper than hosted vector DBs that charge per-hour compute and index size.

Calculation based on S3 Vectors pricing : [https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)

**Caveats**

* It’s still in **preview**, so expect changes
* Not optimized for ultra low-latency use cases
* Vector deletions require full index recreation (currently)
* Index refresh is asynchronous (eventually consistent)

2025-07-26,Hardening Amazon Linux 2023 ami,"Today, we were searching for hardened Amazon Linux 2023 ami in Amazon marketplace. We saw CIS hardened. We found out there is a cost associated. I think it's going to be costly for us since we have around 1800-2000 ec2 instances. Back in the days(late 90s and not AWS), we'd use a very bare OpenBSD and we'd install packages that we only need. I was thinking of doing the same thing in a standard Amazon Linux 2023. However, I am not sure which packages we can uninstall. Does anyone have any notes? Or how did you harden your Amazon Linux 2023?

2025-07-27,Deploying Amazon Connect Solutions with IaC or using the Console?,"Hi folks,

I've always used the console to deploy and manage the Amazon Connect solutions I've created—simple solutions for now. And as I work on more complex solutions, I've realized this is not scalable and could become a problem in the long run (if we integrate new team members for example). I know the industry standard in the cloud is to use IaC as much as possible (or always), for all the aggregated benefits (version control, automatic deployments, tests, etc.). But I've been having such a hard time trying to build these architecture with AWS CDK. I find the AWS CDK support for Amazon Connect is almost non existent.

I was wondering how are you guys out there managing and deploying your Amazon Connect solutions? Are you using IaC o using the console? And if using IaC, which platform are you using —AWS CDK, Terraform, CloudFormation directly (which is a pain for me), etc.

I appreciate you comments.",7,11
2025-07-27,How to set up querying correctly for Amazon S3.,"Hello, everyone. I am currently trying to decide what is the best way to go around something I am trying to create and would like to ask for some ideas. 

Currently, I have settled on using Amazon S3 for storing objects which would be various files containing text and images or just text, however I am not sure how to potentially set up serving of those files correctly if, say, I would build a front end and would need to query those files and serve the right one. 

I have had two ideas, one is using metadata that I define on the upload and then use that metadata to tell the API which exact object to get, however from what I see now I would need to use Athena for it and store a csv file of the inventory which might be cumbersome considering I will potentially have thousands of files.

Another one is just naming the uploaded files in the way that will allow the API to get the right one, however it seems that might be a challenge too since I am not sure if you can set it up fully. 

I just want to be able to quickly find and pick the right object from the S3 and not sure how to go about it considering I am using a Python API with it and I don't always have the namespace for the thing that I need.

Thank you in advance",1,10

2025-07-31,Roku's second quarter earnings outlook: Wall Street is optimistic about its partnership with Amazon and the growth potential of its advertis,"Consumer electronics company Roku (Nasdaq: ROKU) will report its second-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday, July 31. Investors will closely monitor signs of growth in ad inventory, potential growth from its partnership with Amazon, and subscription growth.

Analysts expect Roku to report a loss of $0.16 per share and revenue of $1.07 billion, representing a 10% increase from last year.

Wedbush analysts anticipate that Roku will benefit from its DSP partnerships, high-quality inventory, improved targeting, sports-related advertising, and the variety of price points available on its platform.

Analysts predict that Roku's platform revenue will grow by 14% year-over-year to $940 million, in line with expectations.

Analysts stated, “Nevertheless, given Roku's increasingly diversified business model, expanding advertising opportunities, and achievable parameters across its entire operational model, we believe its guidance still has upside potential.”

Wedbush expects Roku to maintain its 2025 EBITDA guidance and 2026 positive operating income target, similar to the first quarter.

Over the past three months, earnings per share forecasts have been lowered four times, revenue forecasts have been raised twice, and revenue forecasts have been lowered 21 times.

Bank of America analysts recently raised their target price for Roku (ROKU) and reiterated their bullish rating, citing improved macroeconomic sentiment and the favorable impact of its recently announced partnership with Amazon (AMZN).

They noted that the partnership with Amazon “once again demonstrates Roku's intention to become more flexible and further drive interoperability within its platform.”

Roku (ROKU) shares rose over 1% during Wednesday's trading session. Year-to-date, the company's market capitalization has increased by over 21%.",0,1

For Amazon, analysts expect revenue around $162 billion (up 10%) and EPS between $1.32 and $1.33, with operating income projected at $16.7 to $16.87 billion. And during this sesh, the key areas to watch will include AWS growth (estimated at $30.77 billion, up 17%), AI investments (over $100 billion capex planned), and advertising revenue (up 17% to $14.99 billion). Considering the stock performance, it's up 5% year-to-date, with bullish analyst sentiments (e.g., UBS raised price target to $271), but some valuation concerns exist (GF Value at $189.47). External factors like tariffs and Prime Day success could influence outcomes, with potential for significant stock movement based on guidance. I know that people are going to be playing AMZN earnings so I wanted to do a little write up for /r/Stocks so you guys are well informed. And I'll even post what I plan on getting at the end. 

**Analyst Expectations and Financial Projections**

Analysts have provided a range of estimates for Amazon's Q2 performance, showing a lot of optimism. 

Revenue: Expected to be around $162 billion, with variations such as $162.1 billion and $162.19 billion, representing a 9.5% to 10% year-over-year increase.  

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Forecasted at $1.32 to $1.33, up from $1.26 last year, with Amazon having beaten EPS estimates for nine consecutive quarters.  

Operating Income: Projected between $16.7 billion and $16.87 billion, a 13.8% to 15% increase, with an operating margin expected at 10.6% (up from 9.9% last year).  

These projections suggest strong growth, and I honestly think Amazon can exceed these figures and provide robust forward guidance. Especially given its historical ""beat and raise"" pattern, which may not suffice in the current up cycle.

**Key Business Segments and Growth Drivers**

Amazon's diverse operations are expected to drive its Q2 results, with several segments highlighted as critical:  

1) AWS (Amazon Web Services)  

AWS remains a cornerstone of Amazon's profitability, with Q1 2025 revenue up 17% to $29.3 billion. For Q2, net sales are estimated at $30.77 billion, with growth of 17% excluding foreign exchange effects. However, operating margins are expected to drop to 35% due to significant investments in AI and infrastructure, part of a $100+ billion capex plan for 2025. This segment contributed 17% of revenue and 58% of operating income last year, making it a focal point for me.

2) Advertising Revenue  

Advertising is another growth engine, with Q1 2025 revenue up 18%. For Q2, it's projected to rise 17% to $14.99 billion, reflecting increased monetization of Amazon's platform as more businesses leverage its advertising ecosystem.

3) Prime Membership  

Prime membership grew 9% year-over-year to 220 million globally, providing a stable revenue stream through subscription fees. This growth, driven by benefits like free shipping and streaming, is expected to continue supporting Amazon's financials.

4) Operational Efficiency  

Amazon has improved operational efficiency, reducing fulfillment costs and increasing delivery speeds, which should enhance margins. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to balance growth investments with profitability.

5) Investments in AI and Other Areas  

Amazon's commitment to AI is a major theme, with a $100+ billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, primarily focused on AWS and AI services. This includes developing proprietary chips like Trainium2 and partnering with Nvidia to enhance AI capabilities. While these investments may pressure short-term margins, they position Amazon for long-term growth in the expanding AI market. Additionally, Project Kuiper, a satellite initiative, is noted as an area of rising expense, alongside e-commerce and content/advertising investments.

**Analyst sentiments are generally bullish**

UBS raised its price target from $249 to $271, calling Amazon the ""most coiled"" Big Tech name, implying an 18% upside and highlighting extensive investments across e-commerce, AWS, content/advertising, and Kuiper. Other analysts, including Wedbush, William Blair, and Stifel, reiterated ""outperform"" or ""buy"" ratings, with an average price target of $252.66 (range: $195 to $305). 

**External Factors and Market Context**

Several external factors could influence Amazon's earnings and stock reaction:  

Consider the Tariffs. Earlier this year, tariff concerns, particularly on Chinese goods, weighed on the stock, but recovery followed eased U.S. tariffs. Analysts are parsing impacts on e-commerce, with Amazon benefiting from stockpiling ahead of potential tariff hikes.

Also, think about the Prime Day Success. Held in July, Prime Day's performance could lift revenue guidance for the September-ending quarter, providing a positive signal for us.  

And finally, with any earnings post, we need to consider macroeconomic events such as inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending trends could affect retail sales, particularly in online stores and third-party seller revenue, expected to grow 6.5% to $58.99 billion and 7% to $38.74 billion, respectively.

**Potential Catalysts**

I'm expecting accelerating AWS growth, better-than-expected margins, new AI announcements, and strong Q3 guidance. UBS expects upward revisions to operating profit and free-cash-flow as revenue grows, potentially more dramatic than peers.  


**Comparisons**

Microsoft's recent Q2 results, where cloud growth was a significant driver, boosts my confidence in Amazon's cloud business, with MSFT stock jumping 4.47% in after-hours trading. This really does show how important AWS performance will be, as Amazon faces a high bar following Microsoft's strong showing.

**So what to do?**

Amazon's Q2 earnings are poised to be a major event, with strong growth expected across key segments like AWS, advertising, and Prime, supported by significant AI investments. This will be a great opportunity to get a call spread. For those who don't know anything about option trading, you don't need to continue reading. But for those who do, I'll be buying the 8/1 245c (@ 2.67) and selling the 252.5c (@ 1.11). This means I can get the spread for $156, with a potential max gain of 4.8x if AMZN can go up about 7.8% with earnings. Considering the stock moves on average about ±8% with earnings, there's a good chance it'll go up 4-8% today. 

Next week tho, we have a ton more earnings so I think I'll be doing a post on PLTR and AMD.",122,41

And when it comes to reviewing code like giving meaningful PR feedback, catching logical issues, or guiding junior devs in this Amazon Q seems to step back.

I am trying to figure out what are the best practices with regard to connection management between Lambda and DSQL. It doesn't seem to support RDS Proxy or Data API. Which leaves us with two options:

1. Open and close a connection for the duration invocation (avoids connection leak, added latency).

2. Open connection and keep it around (lower latency, may result in leaking (not properly closed) connections).

Is DSQL tolerant towards option 2 (maybe it has internal proxy frontend?) ? If not how bad is added latency in case 1?

Rental car firm Hertz (HTZ) struck a deal with Amazon Autos (AMZN) on Wednesday to sell some of its used car inventory. The company said this will make it easier for customers to purchase cars from its fleet.

Starting today, customers can search Amazon Autos to browse, finance, and purchase from thousands of used Hertz fleet vehicles from brands like Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet, Nissan, and others. Hertz Car Sales, the rental car firm's used car sales arm, will be the first fleet dealer on Amazon Autos.

""Our goal is to reimagine the car-buying experience and meet customers where they are — whether online or in person — with convenience, confidence and scale,"" Hertz Car Sales executive vice president Jeff Adams said in a statement. ""Amazon Autos is the ideal partner to help us deliver on this as customers can shop our expansive inventory of high-quality used cars on the same trusted marketplace where millions shop every day.""

Hertz said sales will begin in the Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and Seattle metro areas, with plans to expand to Hertz Car Sales' 45 locations nationwide. After customers complete their purchase online, they can pick up the vehicles at Hertz locations in those cities.

""This collaboration allows us to offer an expanded selection of well-maintained vehicles from more dealerships across the country, while maintaining the simplicity that customers expect from Amazon,” Global Head of Amazon Autos Fan Jin said in a statement.

Hertz will offer a 115-point inspection process and a 12-month/12,000-mile powertrain warranty. Hertz is also adding a seven-day/250-mile buyback guarantee and 24-hour roadside assistance.

Amazon's addition of Hertz vehicles is another big move for its auto sales business. Late in 2024, Amazon struck a deal with Hyundai (005380.KS) to sell new vehicles in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, among others. Amazon users can buy and finance vehicles from local participating dealers directly on Amazon's website or app.

As for Hertz, the company is coming off something of a PR hit after its newly implemented AI scanning tool for returned vehicles dinged renters with high fees, sometimes thousands of dollars, for damage that renters claim they did not incur.",364,64

2025-09-13,Tried AWS Party Rock because my friend at Amazon asked me to and it actually sucks,"Party Rock is AWS's no-code app builder that's supposed to let you describe an app idea and have AI build it for you automatically.

My friend works at Amazon and wanted me to test it out so I gave it a shot. The UI looks like it was designed by a child but whatever.

The first app I tried to build was pretty simple. Big pink button that sends a fake message when tapped once and emails an emergency contact when tapped twice. It understood the concept fine and went through all the steps.

Took about 25 seconds to build, which was slower than Google's equivalent tool. But when it finished there was literally no pink button. Just text that said ""you'll see a pink button below"" with nothing there.

When I clicked the text it said ""I'm only an AI language model and cannot build interactive physical models"" and told me to call emergency services directly. So it completely failed to build what it claimed it was building.

My second attempt was a blog generator that takes a keyword, finds relevant YouTube videos, and uses transcripts to write blog posts. Again it went through all the setup steps without mentioning it can't access YouTube APIs.

When I actually tried to use it, it told me it's not connected to YouTube and suggested I manually enter video URLs. So it pretended to build something it couldn't actually do.

The third try was a LinkedIn posting scheduler that suggests optimal posting times. Fed it a sample post and it lectured me about spreading misinformation because the post mentioned GPT-5.

At least Google's Opal tells you upfront what it can't do. Party Rock pretends to build functional apps then fails when you try to use them. Pretty disappointing overall.",105,29
2025-09-14,AMZN covered calls free money?!,"We have some vested AMZN RSUs that have been pretty stagnant but I’m bullish on the company and we’re plenty diversified so we’re holding. 




About a month ago I was reading some covered call strategies and AMZN stood out as a decent company to sell covered calls on. So I tried it weekly for the last month, on Friday I’d sell a CC for the next Friday from $130-248 each. After rolling the cost and putting aside some money for the tax man I came out with about $440. That’s just under 2% return for the month. 



If I do this every month and let the cash sit in a money market or reinvest I come out with a pretty healthy profit. Now I just have the 100 shares so it is a bit of effort for just $440/mn but we have more vesting soon and once we get 200-300 shares that’s not bad. 




Here’s where it’s free money:


1. I’ll get this out of the way: I’m completely fine if these get called and I have to sell. It’s been an underperformed and was “free” to begin with. I’m not expecting amzn to have a crazy week and I miss out on a double. 




2. I’ve been selling 232.5 and 235 calls. Amazon has struggled to pass the $240 and only a few times in the last year did it get to $235+ making it fairly unlikely for it then to be called.



3. AMZN shouldn’t have many unexpected upside moves, it’s just not historically likely. Making it somewhat safe. However it does tend to float between $215-230 meaning this should be a fairly sustainable approach for me to keep doing every week or two.




I’m not sure if I’m missing something obvious? Like the biggest risks are losing out on future gains of the shares if it gets called and taxes right? But the taxes are factored in and the return is still decent and the future gains I’m just not particularly worried about and it seems I’d be able to buy back in. I’m genuinely open to advice if I’m fucking something up, but I don’t think I am and it seems like a solid strategy. ",0,15

2025-09-15,AMZN covered calls free money?!,"We have some vested AMZN RSUs that have been pretty stagnant but I’m bullish on the company and we’re plenty diversified so we’re holding. 




About a month ago I was reading some covered call strategies and AMZN stood out as a decent company to sell covered calls on. So I tried it weekly for the last month, on Friday I’d sell a CC for the next Friday from $130-248 each. After rolling the cost and putting aside some money for the tax man I came out with about $440. That’s just under 2% return for the month. 



If I do this every month and let the cash sit in a money market or reinvest I come out with a pretty healthy profit. Now I just have the 100 shares so it is a bit of effort for just $440/mn but we have more vesting soon and once we get 200-300 shares that’s not bad. 




Here’s where it’s free money:


1. I’ll get this out of the way: I’m completely fine if these get called and I have to sell. It’s been an underperformed and was “free” to begin with. I’m not expecting amzn to have a crazy week and I miss out on a double. 




2. I’ve been selling 232.5 and 235 calls. Amazon has struggled to pass the $240 and only a few times in the last year did it get to $235+ making it fairly unlikely for it then to be called.



3. AMZN shouldn’t have many unexpected upside moves, it’s just not historically likely. Making it somewhat safe. However it does tend to float between $215-230 meaning this should be a fairly sustainable approach for me to keep doing every week or two.




I’m not sure if I’m missing something obvious? Like the biggest risks are losing out on future gains of the shares if it gets called and taxes right? But the taxes are factored in and the return is still decent and the future gains I’m just not particularly worried about and it seems I’d be able to buy back in. I’m genuinely open to advice if I’m fucking something up, but I don’t think I am and it seems like a solid strategy. ",0,15

	2.	Is there a way to use test orders or a mock marketplace for fulfillment APIs?

2025-09-18,Need Help with AWS Architecture: Using Lambda to Bridge Amazon Verified Access and a Legacy App,"I'm working on securing a legacy EPM  application and could use some advice on the best way to configure the AWS components.

My Goal:

I want to use Amazon Verified Access (AVA) to secure the application. The problem is, the application doesn't understand JWTs; it only supports simple header-based authentication (it looks for a header like iv-user).

**Current Setup:**

* The EPM workspace is running on EC2 instances.
* An **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** distributes traffic to these instances.
* I have **Amazon Verified Access** set up, pointing to the ALB.

Proposed Solution:

My plan is to insert a Lambda function into the request flow. The idea is:

1. AVA authenticates the user and forwards the request to the ALB, adding the signed JWT in the `x-amz-verified-access-jwt` header.
2. The ALB listener rule first sends the request to a **Lambda function**.
3. The Lambda function decodes the JWT, gets the username, and prepares to put it in an `iv-user` header.

My Question:

What's the correct way to configure the ALB listener rule to achieve this to send the request back to ALB after the getting the header  for both conditions, or any other tweaks required for this setup

Has anyone built a similar setup? Any tips or potential pitfalls would be greatly appreciated!

2025-09-22,Would you keep 40% of your portfolio in AMZN to avoid capital gains tax?,"I've vested Amazon shares over the years and I sell to cover then leave them in AMZN. I have that portfolio of 100% AMZN, and another one that I actively manage which is about 40% SPY, 20% bonds and gold, and 40% in individual stocks. 

I ran the numbers and, when both portfolios are combined, 40% of my holdings are AMZN. 

My AMZN portfolio is +30% overall. I know I'm overweight in AMZN due to the shares given to me. I want to sell about half of the AMZN shares and put that money into SPY and bonds. 

About half of the AMZN shares have been held over a year so its short term capital tax, the other half last than a year. That doesn't really matter as I would sell ""first in first out"" if I redistributed some of AMZN shares. 

Given the tax implications, what's a sound strategy I should do? Continue holding all AMZN in my one port? Sell a portion and redistribute?

2025-09-24,How to track Amazon Q Developer generated code vs manually written code in our codebase?,"Hey devs,

Our team recently started using Amazon Q Developer and management wants to track metrics on how much code is AI-generated vs manually written by developers.

**What we're looking for:**

* Ways to distinguish between Q-generated code and human-written code in our repos
* Tools or methods to measure the ratio of AI vs manual contributions
* Best practices for tracking AI code generation impact on productivity

**What we've considered so far:**

* Amazon Q's built-in analytics (though docs seem focused on usage metrics, not code tracking) - [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/monitoring-overview.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/monitoring-overview.html)

**Questions:**

1. Does Amazon Q Developer have any built-in features to track generated code that gets accepted/used?
2. Are there any tools that can analyze existing codebases to identify potentially AI-generated sections?
3. How are other teams handling this kind of tracking for compliance/metrics purposes?

We're using mostly Python/JavaScript if that matters for tooling recommendations.

Thanks in advance! Really curious how other teams are approaching this.

Note: This is for internal metrics and productivity analysis, not for any punitive measures against devs using AI tools.",5,13
