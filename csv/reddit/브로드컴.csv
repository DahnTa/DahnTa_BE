What is that percentage?

What led to that decision?

Chevron (CVX) is 6.69% of my current portfolio and is the biggest. 

I think the company is a better exposure to the energy sector than the alternatives.

2024-10-06,American Funds generally exclude Nvidia. So disappointing.,"I inherited a sizable Roth IRA, and looked at the portfolio composition and was disappointed that Nvidia is not even a part of many of their funds.

The 4 funds that are in the portfolio have such a large overlap, it makes no sense why the financial planner would do this. The expense ratios are extremely high, and the holdings make no sense either:

The amount of money that was ""lost"" by not having more more exposure to nvidia is absurd. Why don't their funds just track the S&P 500?

I plan to hold onto this Roth for the next 10 years, let it grow, then make a lump sum RMD, but I am very upset over the high expense ratios of about 0.63%.

I am considering selling these positions and buying just one good one that has more of nvidia. I really don't like these expense ratios and it almost feels like extortion.

I have also considered looking into an Inherited Roth IRA transfer to fidelity, if that's even possible. Is it even possible to transfer an inherited Roth IRA?",0,21

2024-10-11,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Oct 11, 2024","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

Mama always told me I might not be the smartest, but I had a knack for keepin' things simple, and that’s worked out pretty well. I got me some Nvidia, and now it’s goin’ up faster than I could ever run. And I know runnin’—so I figured that was a good sign. Broadcom? Well, I don’t know much about chips, but it seems to me that if all these tech companies need them, it’s like buyin' up the whole bus instead of just a ticket.

And Bitcoin? Now that’s a funny thing. It’s like money, but you can’t touch it, so it took me a while to understand, but Mama always said sometimes the best things in life ain’t the things you can hold. So I reckon Bitcoin’s the future, and even if I don’t fully get it, I know to hold on tight. You don’t need to be a genius to see that Microsoft and Apple are like sure bets, so I got me some of those too. Sometimes, keepin’ it simple is the smartest thing of all.",1490,149

2024-11-05,Nvidia Overtakes Apple to Become World's Largest Company,"
Nvidia stock was rising early Monday, pushing its market capitalization past Apple's to make the chip maker the world's largest company.

Nvidia shares were up 1.4% at $137.35 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Friday.

That gave Nvidia a market cap of $3.365 trillion, just ahead of Apple's $3.338 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Continued high spending from big technology companies on artificial-intelligence infrastructure, including the company's Blackwell processors, look to be a more fundamental driver for Nvidia stock.

""We have further raised our big tech capex forecasts following the quarterly results last week. We now expect their combined spending to grow 50% this year to $222 billion, and another 20% to $267 billion in 2025,"" wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a research note.

Intel shares were down 2.9% in morning trading. Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices was off 0.6% and Broadcom rose 1.7%.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",824,192

2024-11-13,Out of the “Big 7” any you’d recommend buying over others?,"Wanna buy 2-3 of the big 7 stocks, atm thinking of google, Nvidia, and maybe another.
All these stocks are at the highest they’ve ever been basically so maybe not best to buy but who knows if the market will keep climbing so I’ll buy and hold for probably 2 years at least. If I need to hold longer for that I probably can. I’m somewhat new to investing so just wanna see y’all’s thoughts. Should I just wait? That would be timing the market and seems like a bad idea haha. Buying now and averaging my price down if need be sounds smarter.",37,160

2024-12-14,NVIDIA: A Victim of Its Own Success,"People wondering today why AVGO spiked but isn’t helping NVDA. In fact, there are now (idiotic) rumors that AVGO’s business booming is bad for NVDA.
Just so you guys are aware, Broadcom competes with Mavel in specialized custom GPU chips (which cost, say $400-500 million a chip). NVDA competes with AMD (although AMD is like miles behind) in non-specialized GPU chips which come with software (CUDA), development assistance etc for companies. 

NVDA and Broadcom DO NOT directly compete. Broadcom is NOT a threat to NVDA’s business. However, NVDA can be a huge threat to Broadcom. If NVDA tells big tech they will produce custom chips for them, Broadcom’s business will take a MASSIVE hit. Broadcom cannot compete with NVDA or even AMD in the non-specialized GPU chips section because there’s a software lock in, logistics base etc that NVDA has already developed.

Now, why is NVDA stock getting destroyed? Because it became too popular, and now trades so purely on swings in the market due to lots of retail traders etc, that good news barely moves it etc. There’s very little correlation. Expectations to NVDA now are so sky high—the expectation is that NVDA will always beat, so it’s hard for the stock to blow away expectations anymore. Compare that with Broadcom, which isn’t the most popular AI name (i.e. NVDA). That keeps overall sentiment much more tame for AVGO allowing it to blow out even though the quarter was mixed.

If news came out tomorrow that Blackwell is selling like hot cakes, stock still wouldn’t move on it. NVDA’s stock has become a victim of its own success—of its popularity. When I invested in the stock in 2018, it acted much more rationally than the stock price does nowadays.

2024-12-17,NVDA vs AVGO,"NVDIA vs Broadcom
I have a pretty big position in NVDA but am obviously not too thrilled with the stock performance since June.

While I am still bullish on NVIDIA and AI, there are a few things that make me pause

Apple doing its whole Apple Intelligence thing not planning to spend a single dollar with NVIDIA but rather building custom chips with Broadcom
Anthropic going all-in with Amazon's Trainium chips. In the past, big funding for AI startups meant a big check for Jensen. This didn't happen here and could set a precedent
Broadcom announcing that it will build 1 million XPU (ASIC) data centers with hyperscalers.
So while NVIDIA is clearly ahead of AMD, I don't like the shift to Broadcom ASIC chips. And to be honest it makes a lot of sense to me that Meta or Amazon would build their own chips to do stuff like recommendation engines.

So my question is: would you diversify/sell some NVDA stock to buy AVGO in order to be able to benefit both from the GPU and ASIC trends?",12,37
2024-12-17,$AVGO Analysis [DD]  ----,"Broadcom(AVGO)

This ticker is surfing multiple growth waves, including the AI boom, 5G rollout, and enterprise software takeover. My research reflects a top-tier supplier of custom chips powering cloud titans like AWS and Google Cloud, and its recent $61 billion VMware acquisition just opened a fat new cash spigot with juicy profit margins. With AI and 5G still in the early innings, Broadcoms got a serious baller vibe rn.

Financially, Broadcom is a cash cow. Were talking monster gross margins at 75% and a cash-printing machine generating around $16 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Dividends are popping off, up 24% annually over five years, and the current yield at 2.3% isnt too shabby for a growth beast.

On valuation, this stock looks like a steal. Trading at \~20x forward earnings, its way cheaper than high-flyers like NVIDIA, despite packing serious growth potential. Analysts are eyeing the $1,000+ zone for the stock in the next few years, which spells a tasty upside from here.

The risks? Regulatory heat and a macro slowdown could throw some shade, but Broadcoms diversified playbook spreads the risk nicely.

TL;DR: Broadcom is a money-printing machine crushing it in semis and software. With AI, 5G, and VMware in its corner, this one’s a no-brainer. Slap a $950 short-term target on it, and long-term, its got legs to hit $1,200+.

This is a strong buy imho especially with guidance into 2027!!

2024-12-18,Broadcom’s Nvidia moment ,"The rally in shares of chipmaker Broadcom after last week’s earnings is reminiscent of when Nvidia’s stock started to take off in 2023. Broadcom now needs to prove it can follow through to become another giant of the AI era.

Broadcom shares have soared 38% since it reported, pushing its market value to almost $1.2 trillion. At the heart of the rally is Broadcom’s prediction that the market for AI components it designs for data centers will be as big as $90 billion in three years. But there’s a lot to be done to turn that into reality.

""This is kind of like the Nvidia moment of maybe a year and a half ago where they blew the number out and everybody had to catch up and chase it,” per Ken Mahoney of Mahoney Asset Management. Broadcom is showing investors that AI computing is so big that there’s plenty of room for other winners aside from Nvidia.

Broadcom stock is up 124% this year, set for its biggest annual gain ever. The stock is now priced at 38 times estimated earnings, suggesting the company has limited room for error. Nvidia, though, has set a bullish precedent for investors wanting to jump onto the next big potential AI winner. Its profits grew so fast last year that the valuation actually got cheaper as the stock rose, because estimates were being raised at an even faster clip.",79,21

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-12-20,AMD is the biggest opportunity in the Semi space ,"To the victor go the spoils and AMD beat Intel, so now its time to reap the rewards of being the biggest in their space. I think Intel will be sold and parts of their business bought out by various companies and the Fab business separated from the chip side of things. Leaving AMD as the go to company for microchips as they are miles ahead.

Look at your work or home computer, would it be able to run a next gen AI app or AI software in the next year or so?

There has been some concern this week with Micron and the PC business but i think the market is overlooking the fact that there is a massive upgrade cycle coming for AI personal computers. Think about all the outdated PC's that are currently out there. That's thousands of companies and corporations, Universities/colleges/schools, data centers and personal home computers that are not optimized for AI and the AI apps that will come down the pipeline next year. The addressable market is massive, this isn't limited to the US but think Europe, Asia, South America all looking to have an AI enabled PC in their office or home. You cant have the AI software development without having AI enabled PC's. Apple discovered this with their AI phones. You need upgrades on CPU's, Upgraded GPU's, Upgraded RAM and hard drives/storage.

Next lets talk about custom chip designs. The market went wild when Broadcom brought this up. No one realizes that AMD has been working on this for a while. They also make AI accelerators that directly compete with everyone else in performance. Their website has a list of their products this isnt something new they are jumping into.

The total addressable market is massive.

2024-12-21,AVGO Price Manipulation? Observations from Today’s Trading Activity,"Hey guys,

I noticed what seems to be a clear example of price manipulation by hedge funds/market makers today, and I wanted to share my observations.

This morning, I added AVGO $227.5 Put (expiring today 12/20) to my watchlist. For context, AVGO’s ex-dividend date is Monday, Dec 23, meaning anyone holding shares as of today, Friday, Dec 20, will be eligible for a dividend payout of $0.59 per share—a decent amount.

Here’s what I observed on the 1-minute daily chart:
	
•	At exactly 3:50 PM EST, there was a 1M share sell order, which dropped AVGO’s share price from ~$226 to just over $220.
	
•	Then, at 4:00 PM EST, a massive 46.5M share green candle appeared, but the stock price barely moved.

Here’s my take: It seems like the price was deliberately manipulated down to $220.x by selling a relatively small number of shares (1M) to make a larger chunk (46.5M) more affordable. This allowed institutions to load up on shares just before the ex-dividend date to secure the hefty payout.

To add to the intrigue, the option I was watching suddenly spiked from $0.90 to $8.50 during this timeframe.

Am I understanding this correctly? Could this be a textbook example of price manipulation, or am I missing something? Would love to hear your thoughts and analysis.",15,30

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

I'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).

2) They have been spending huge amounts of money on AI and server equipment, research and development.

3) Investors don't believe that they will be the winners in the AI race - they aren't really a competitor to Nvidia, and other chip manufacturers like Broadcom have better AI offerings.

2025-01-08,The outlook for ASML & the lithography industry,"ASML just had its investor day, and the big takeaway was that they stuck to their long-term revenue forecast. That definitely calmed some nerves after the recent 2025 downgrade and a pretty lackluster year for orders.

But if you dig a little deeper, there are some interesting shifts happening in the semiconductor world, especially with AI shaking things up. One standout is memory—because datacenter GPUs rely so heavily on volatile memory, ASML seriously bumped up its growth forecast for DRAM wafer volumes over the next six years. On the flip side, NAND wafer growth took a pretty big hit:

https://preview.redd.it/879zmvu1ilbe1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb72ad6bb45052ab9028a48f22bf0eebcc38db69

A bunch of this growth is still gonna happen in the cloud, with AI training and inference servers pumping up the datacenter semis market and keeping that sweet CAGR looking good.

https://preview.redd.it/kcyqaikbilbe1.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc621546147cec2050d89625b5bce03b3e47eda4

As AI servers are both DDR and HBM intensive, this drives the strongly expected growth in the number of DRAM wafers mentioned above:

# ASML’s High-NA Outlook

ASML’s take on high-NA is basically, “We’re good to go—the tools are ready, we’re ready, and the ecosystem’s ready.” The only catch? Because the optics are bigger, these tools use a half-field exposure. In plain English, that means each shot only prints half the circuit design compared to older EUV systems, which isn’t great for productivity. But ASML says they’ve tackled this by speeding up how quickly the tool moves between fields.

Looking at the numbers, high-NA can crank out 175 wafers per hour (WPH), which is pretty solid, especially when you compare it to the latest version of regular EUV running at 220 WPH.

https://preview.redd.it/hjhkqgrp6mbe1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=467cc6c3d6172df2576d7851ea9f87c8b0ef3824

Bottom line—high-NA’s productivity is already impressive and even better than the older EUV systems ASML has out there. Plus, there’s a clear plan to make these tools even faster. Honestly, it’s wild to think about how chaotic EUV was a decade ago, with everyone freaking out about whether it would ever actually catch on.

# EUV just keeps leveling up

ASML had a tough time getting EUV off the ground at first—early tools couldn’t hit decent source power, and productivity kind of sucked. But since then, they’ve been on a mission to crank up source power and, in turn, boost productivity.

**Here’s the deal:** more source power means wafers get exposed faster, so the tools can churn through more wafers per hour. And more wafers per hour? That’s good news for everyone. ASML gets to slap higher price tags on its tools and rake in better margins, while customers lower their cost per wafer by cranking out more in less time.

https://preview.redd.it/qr388t047mbe1.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f6f7a585a1ae641ac1b6502cf8829dc0314bbdb

And this isn’t the end of the story. ASML’s already got a solid roadmap to keep pushing productivity even higher for both its low-NA and high-NA tools, so there’s plenty more to come.

# ASML’s 2030 Game Plan

ASML isn’t just about building cutting-edge litho tools—they’re also pros at mapping out long-term financial goals. Here’s how they do it: they take a guess at how many wafers will be pumped out at each node by 2030, then work backward to figure out how many exposures those wafers will need using their tools. They factor in everything—EUV, immersion, basic DUV, KrF, i-line, and metrology.

Next, they estimate how productive each tool will be, which helps them figure out how many tools need to be in the market and how many more they’ll need to sell. On top of that, they throw in around EUR 12 billion a year in revenue just for servicing all the tools already out there.

When you crunch the numbers, it adds up to somewhere between EUR 44 and 60 billion in revenue by 2030. And if you look at ASML’s track record, they’ve always hit or even beaten their targets. To make a solid return on this stock, we probably need to see them hit at least EUR 50 billion in revenue.

https://preview.redd.it/ju29xczm7mbe1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=21d0fc95ad1b6bcfada4949443545473b050fe87

As for margins, the guidance isn’t crazy aggressive. Honestly, the only reason the advanced semi industry is still scaling at all is because of ASML. Yet, weirdly enough, their margins are still lower than a lot of other big players in silicon. Go figure.

https://preview.redd.it/1bgzjxqp7mbe1.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c3f525119e7a75c74e04ffa9e2ac278fdbced1

# The Bull Case for ASML

**Let’s be real—ASML has basically been selling its tools at a discount.** It’s hands-down the most dominant player in the entire semiconductor game, with zero competition. Compare that to TSMC, which still has to keep an eye on Samsung, Intel, and maybe even Rapidus in advanced chipmaking. ARM has to watch out for RISC-V, Cadence and Synopsys are still duking it out, Nvidia’s losing some datacenter accelerator share to Broadcom and Marvell, and Analog Devices has to compete with Texas Instruments and Microchip in analog semis.

Don’t get me wrong—these companies are all in strong positions with solid growth prospects. But when it comes to a **true monopoly?** ASML is in a league of its own.

Now check this out—TSMC has consistently outperformed ASML when it comes to gross margins. And honestly, it’s mostly the American companies that know how to squeeze every dollar out of a dominant position. ASML could’ve been pulling in 60–65% gross margins like Nvidia has done in the past if they wanted to, but they’ve been way too nice about pricing. Let’s face it—this isn’t a business that should be settling for 50% gross margins.

https://preview.redd.it/ryfd39x68mbe1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed50e3ab62a6f1b4a2e77857294e9e92228741b6

# Conclusion

ASML is basically a bet on keeping Moore’s Law alive and pushing the scaling roadmap forward. Right now, the risk-reward balance still looks pretty good—mainly because TSMC and Intel are both making solid progress and have a clear game plan for the Angstrom era. Plus, their top-tier customers in high-performance computing are more than willing to shell out big bucks for the performance boosts these Angstrom chips deliver.

Looking at the current valuation, it’s actually pretty fair for what ASML’s got going on. Investors are basically paying the same kind of multiple they did six years ago—back when the outlook was just as strong as it is now and the stock absolutely skyrocketed.

2025-01-08,Nvidia: Expect Valuation To Soar Higher On 2025's AI Spending Increases,"# Summary

* Nvidia’s 2024 revenue surged by 86% to $113.3 billion, with operating income doubling to $71 billion.
* Hyperscalers are expected to increase AI-focused capital expenditures by 50% in 2025, reaching $300 billion.
* Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell architecture offers up to 15x performance improvements, securing its 90% market dominance in AI GPUs.
* Competitors like AMD and Broadcom struggle with ecosystem integration and software optimization, solidifying Nvidia’s lead.
* Analysts project a 50x earnings multiple and a target price of $225 per share for 2025.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) enjoyed unprecedented financial success in 2024, driven by a wave of hyperscaler investments in data center infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Revenues soared by 86%, reaching $113.3 billion, while operating income more than doubled to $71 billion, signaling the company’s dominance in the AI sector.

Despite such robust growth, concerns over a potential slowdown are misplaced. The global push toward AI and machine learning shows no signs of waning. Leading technology giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Google are significantly expanding their high-performance computing capabilities to meet the surging demand for generative AI, large language models, and advanced AI applications.

In 2024, hyperscaler capital expenditures on data centers totaled approximately $200 billion. For 2025, this figure is projected to rise by 50%, hitting $300 billion. According to Morgan Stanley, Amazon and Microsoft are set to lead this spending spree with investments of $96.4 billion and $89.9 billion, respectively. Google and Meta will closely follow, allocating $62.6 billion and $52.3 billion to their AI-driven infrastructure.

This aggressive investment is underpinned by statements from top executives. Google’s CFO noted that while growth in capital expenditures won’t match the leap between 2023 and 2024, further increases are expected. Similarly, Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted plans for significant growth in infrastructure spending. Microsoft, too, has committed $80 billion for AI-oriented data center construction in fiscal 2025.

Nvidia, with its 90% share of the AI GPU market, is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this surge in spending. The release of its next-generation Blackwell architecture in early 2025 promises substantial performance gains, including up to 2.5 times the training performance of its Hopper GPUs and as much as 15 times higher inference capabilities in select benchmarks. These advancements, paired with Nvidia’s proprietary CUDA platform, reinforce its unassailable ecosystem of hardware and software solutions.

Competitors like AMD and Broadcom continue to face hurdles. AMD’s MI300X GPUs, while promising on paper, have failed to deliver comparable performance due to software deficiencies. Broadcom’s custom silicon projects, although intriguing, lack the versatility and support ecosystem Nvidia GPUs provide. Consequently, neither competitor poses a significant threat in the near term, with meaningful competition unlikely before 2026 or 2027.

# TL;DR

Nvidia’s remarkable 2024 growth, fueled by hyperscaler investments, will continue as AI spending surges 50% in 2025 to $300 billion. With its dominant 90% GPU market share and groundbreaking Blackwell architecture, Nvidia is well-positioned for further success.

2025-01-11,Is it important for investors to differentiate between value and growth stocks?,"As a newer investor coming from the ETF side of things, a ""value"" approach has been my first way of learning to look at companies. I'm thinking more about their story, how they make money, whether they do it consistently, P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA, low debt, etc. 

I lurk around on r/ValueInvesting and have gotten some good book recommendations, although I mostly use them for reference rather than reading them in their entirety. 

The S&P 500 was at a P/E ratio of over 100 in 2008 when the market crashed, although there have been pullbacks and recessions with lower P/Es than at current levels. All that to say, maybe the market is overvalued by traditional valuation metrics. I guess I'm trying to understand why many users and even successful YouTubers like Joseph Carlson and others recommend many high P/E companies. I gather that these companies have a sustainable competitive advantage with a lot of growth priced in. I'm talking about companies like SPGI, ASML, GOOGL (this actually seems like a growth company with decent valuations), UBER, ARM, NVDA, AVGO, META, FTNT, AMD, etc.

These companies seem to have a good moat, great CEO's, strong balance sheets but a lot of growth priced in. Frankly, it seems like one could do quite well with companies like these. I've underperformed significantly (thankfully with small positions for the purposes of gaining experience) picking stocks with what I thought were traditional value metrics, companies like HDSN, JILL, ALB, CP, VIRC, etc. Granted, I don't really feel like I have a circle of competence and didn't look too much into how these companies make money. I'll admit that I was riding mostly on the convictions of others, which I recognize is a major issue in itself that I intend to correct going forward. 

So for those of you who invest in individual companies and have had success, here are some questions;

1) Is it productive to differentiate between growth and value companies?

2) Is it fruitful to look for companies with a 10-15 P/E ratio and other ""deep value"" metrics or is traditional value investing dead altogether due to modern age computing power?

3) Does the rise in popularity of index investing exacerbate irrationality in markets to the point where valuations don't matter?

Any insights are greatly appreciated. I read most of my books through osmosis but am probably going to have to get over that. I look forward to good discussion and your replies. Have a great weekend!",15,8

So, typically, I am a dividend-growth investor. I buy, hold, and compound stocks like V, AVGO, COST, UNH, etc, for the long-term.

A new thing I'm doing on the side is stockpiling SPAXX. Basically, I took my main expenses and made an individual account for each. For example, one is ""Health Insurance,"" one ""Electricity and Gas,"" another ""Property Taxes,"" and another ""Gasoline. I simply sweep $$$ into SPAXX in each. I presume the SPAXX yield will go no lower than 3.5%. I then operate under the assumption of a 3.5% yield. 3.5% of 1600 is 56.

Some people when hearing this idea say it's bad because you're only getting 3.5% from SPAXX but despite reading the post forget that the NVDY is yielding 80%+. For ""Electricity and Gas"" I have $8600 SPAXX in it, and it's buying $1 of NVDY every weekday, and that yield from NVDY keeps growing and will be used to more easily cover my gas and electric bill. I don't pull any $$$ from the SPAXX itself unless there's a true emergency. If the stock the residual SPAXX interest is buying goes bad (say NVDY crashes and burns) I can easily swap it out for something else. It's like building up fortified walls of financial stability. I then basically pretend they're not there while they're still growing.

The goal would be to have all major expenses eventually covered. Buying NVDY/MSTY/CONY with the interest will eventually lead to COST/UNH/V/etc being bought later. I see it as shoring up my financial defenses.",1,7

2025-01-13,Investing Thoughts --- Moneycrafting,"At times I just don't understand how dogmatic investors can be, presuming you should only invest one way and automatically shooting down any new idea they haven't considered before. Based on history I know how toxic redditors can be and have seen it frequently, but I'm hoping to actually get some quality feedback for once.

  
So, typically, I am a dividend-growth investor. I buy, hold, and compound stocks like V, AVGO, COST, UNH, etc, for the long-term.

A new thing I'm doing on the side is stockpiling SPAXX. Basically, I took my main expenses and made an individual account for each. For example, one is ""Health Insurance,"" one ""Electricity and Gas,"" another ""Property Taxes,"" and another ""Gasoline. I simply sweep $$$ into SPAXX in each. I presume the SPAXX yield will go no lower than 3.5%. I then operate under the assumption of a 3.5% yield. 3.5% of 1600 is 56. For each $1600 of SPAXX I have it set to automatically buy $1 of NVDY forever, and it covers one weekday, so a Monday.

2025-01-16,TSM Earnings: Is AVGO's 2024 Revenue Quadrupling to $90B? The Signs Point to YES!,"Broadcom (AVGO) is on the verge of an explosion, and it's all thanks to AI. Their recent earnings call wasn't just good; it was a game-changer. **And guess what? TSM's latest earnings call just confirmed everything!**

CEO Hock Tan predicts AVGO's AI chip market (XPUs and networking) could reach **$60 BILLION to $90 BILLION by 2027**! That's up from around $12 billion today. We're talking about a potential **4x increase or more** – the same kind of growth that made Nvidia what it is today.

**Here's the key:**

* **TSM Confirms the Trend:** TSM, the world's leading chip manufacturer and a key supplier for Broadcom, reported HUGE demand for AI chips in their recent earnings call 

>we now forecast the revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period starting off the already higher base of 2024. We expect AI accelerator to be the strongest driver of our HPC platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of our overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. 

* This is a major indicator that the AI chip boom is REAL and Broadcom is in the right place at the right time.
* **Hyperscaler Demand:** Three major cloud companies (hyperscalers) are driving this growth, and Broadcom is working with two more.
* **Custom Chips are King:** Google's Gemini uses Broadcom's custom chips (TPUs). This proves that specialized chips are essential for large-scale AI. Off-the-shelf just won't cut it.
* **VMware Integration:** The VMware acquisition is successful and profitable.
* **Broadcom's Expertise:** They're the best at designing and making these custom AI chips.

Broadcom is positioned to dominate the AI chip market, just like Nvidia. The growth won't be overnight, but the long-term potential is massive.

Here's the kicker: AVGO's revenue could potentially quadruple, yet the stock price is only up around 20% in the past month! **This means there's a HUGE gap between the potential future value and the current price.** AVGO is seriously undervalued right now.

**TL;DR:** AVGO is about to become a major player in the AI chip market. $60-90 billion in potential revenue by 2027 (possibly 4x growth or more), driven by custom chip demand from big cloud companies. TSM's earnings call confirms this is happening NOW. **The stock price hasn't caught up to the potential yet, meaning there's a lot of room to grow.** This could be the next NVDA.",37,34

I've invested long term in the defense sector companies and ETF's, and I'm looking to take a more proactive role in my trades with my new capital. I heard about this big joint Stargate deal and I wanted more information before I start building an investment portfolio.  
  
I read that the Data Centers are already being built in Abilene, Texas and started thinking of which part of this deal would be the best to invest in. There are the investors: MDX, Softbank, Blue Owl Capital, and Microsoft; The tech infrastructure players: Nvidia, OpenAI, Broadcom, TSMC, Oracle; And then the physical building & energy infrastructure that I'm most interested in.  
  
My thought process is: Regardless of whether or not the OpenAI deal follows through or not, builders and energy companies in the area will be getting a lot of money coming their way.  
I wasn't able to find any specific mentions of who is contracted to build out these Datacenters, who will be providing the electricity, nor whether they're publicly traded so I can invest. Any information about them, or how to find the ""back-end"" of these deals, and which companies/ETF's may get boosted by proximity or direct involvement is really appreciated, thank you guys.

2025-01-27,Sell side analyst notes on NVDA this morning,"BofA: 'DeepSeek Concerns Overblown in AI Semis; but Foundational Models Keep Demand High'

 ""On January 20, China-based AI lab DeepSeek created a mini-flurry in the AI semiconductor space by releasing a free, open-source R1 model that reportedly outperforms leading Western AI models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4. The model's creators claimed it took only two months and less than $6 million to build using older-generation NVIDIA H800 chips.

If accurate, this advancement suggests model usefulness and accuracy might not scale directly with compute/memory/networking, potentially reducing the demand for expensive AI chips. However, we believe this concern about slowing AI scaling is overstated. Based on available data, DeepSeek's model appears to be a 'distilled' model relying on larger foundation models like Meta's open-source Llama.

It is these foundational LLMs where significant and rising infrastructure costs are incurred, as evidenced by Meta's plan to raise CY25E capex by over 56% year-over-year to $60-$65 billion. In our view, we will continue to see increasing compute demand driven by a mix of large foundational models (both proprietary and open-source), derivative models (leveraging techniques such as knowledge distillation, sparse attention, and low-rank factorization), and inference at scale across diverse cloud, enterprise, and sovereign AI customers.

We maintain our Buy ratings on NVIDIA (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Marvell Technology (MRVL).""

JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande: ""Investors are concerned that rather than impede China's progress in AI, the US restrictions have engendered innovation that has enabled the development of a model that prioritises efficiency. ... The news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of Microsoft, which is spending $80bn in '25, while Meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn. Open AI also announced that the Stargate project intends to invest $500m over the next four years building new AI infrastructure in the US. Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek's highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible."" 

Jefferies analyst Edison Lee: ""Re-evaluating computing power needs could cause 2026 AI Capex to fall (or not grow)...We believe DS's success could drive two possible industry strategies: 1) still pursue more computing power to drive even faster model improvements, and 2) refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026."" 

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon: ""Is DeepSeek doomsday for AI buildouts? We don't think so...we believe that 1) DeepSeek DID NOT ""build OpenAI for $5M""; 2) the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and 3) the resulting Twitterverse panic over the weekend seems overblown."" Though Rasgon acknowledged DeepSeek's models are good. The analyst kept his outperform ratings on Nvidia and Broadcom, advising clients not to buy into the doomsday scenarios. 

Citi analyst Malik: ""While the dominance of the US companies on the most advanced AI models could be potentially challenged, that said, we estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US' access to more advanced chips is an advantage. Thus, we don't expect leading AI companies would move away from more advanced GPUs."" Malik maintained a buy rating on Nvidia . 

Raymond James' semiconductor analyst Srini Pajjuri: ""If DeepSeek's innovations are adopted broadly, an argument can be made that model training costs could come down significantly even at U.S. hyperscalers, potentially raising questions about the need for 1-million XPU/GPU clusters as projected by some...: A more logical implication is that DeepSeek will drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers to leverage their key advantage (access to GPUs) to distance themselves from cheaper alternatives."" Pajjuri reiterated buy ratings on Nvidia and ASML. 

Cantor analyst C.J. Muse: ""Following release of DeepSeek's V3 LLM, there has been great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs. We think this view is farthest from the truth and that the announcement is actually very bullish with AGI seemingly closer to reality and Jevons Paradox almost certainly leading to the AI industry wanting more compute, not less."" Muse said buy Nvidia on any weakness.",141,102

2025-01-28,"Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history","Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.

The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

The selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. 

Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”

The analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”

But after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.

Data center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.

For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.

Nvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.

CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.

The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.

Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.

“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.

2025-01-29,Broadcom - More Growth Potential With Custom Chips,"Last time Braodcom reported earnings their stock shot up on blowout results and got the whole community buzzing about custom chips(ASIC- Application Specific Integrated Circuit) and i think that was just the start for this line of business. 

What deepseek revealed was you can do equally or more with less and shows that not everyone needs a Blackwell GPU and it doesnt make sense for every application or model. It would come as a surprise if deepseek was able to do what they did with ASIC.

ASIC chips are designed specifically for a particular task, like AI processing, which makes them much more efficient than general-purpose hardware like CPUs or GPUs for those tasks. 

I think as the hyperscalers explore new options custom silicon will grow in favor for AI development over GPU's:

[https://www.broadcom.com/products/custom-silicon](https://www.broadcom.com/products/custom-silicon)

**Energy Efficiency**: ASICs are highly optimized for specific AI algorithms, meaning they can perform tasks like matrix multiplications or neural network computations much faster and with much less power consumption than general-purpose chips. Using less power means a smaller electric bill. 

**Speed**: Since they are custom-built for specific functions, ASICs can process computations much faster than CPUs or GPUs. For tasks like training deep learning models, they can greatly reduce the time needed compared to general-purpose processors.

**Scalability**: ASICs can be scaled and optimized for a range of AI applications, from edge devices to large data centers, making them adaptable to different AI needs without the inefficiency of general-purpose chips.

**Lower Latency**: The customizable options for  ASICs means that they can reduce the time it takes for data to move between different processing stages, which can be crucial in real-time AI applications, like autonomous vehicles, robotics and LLM's.

**Cost Effectiveness**: It can be more cost-effective than relying on GPUs or CPUs for large-scale AI computations, especially for companies with specific, recurring AI tasks.

I think Broadcom earnings are going to continue to outperform, the pieces on the board are always moving. ",11,8

2025-01-30,Buy back chip/AI stocks that triggered Stop-Loss sales?,"That drop in chip/AI stocks earlier this week triggered Stop-Loss sales on my SITM, GEV, AVGO, NVDA, MRVL, & BE holdings, but the price didn't drop much further than my Stop price, and now they're all back slightly above what I sold them for. Do I buy them back? Should my Stop-Loss orders have had more buffer in them?


Edit to add:
I'd like to clarify that the stop loss sales were still an overall gain for me on my investments. The stop loss was to protect _gains_. Regardless of my sales having been an automated stop loss order, even if I had made the sales personally, the situation is the same. ",9,72
2025-01-30,"Meta's CAPEX Spending Exceeds the Combined Net Income of F, TSLA, IBM, AVGO, GM, and V","**META** plans to spend **$60-$65 billion** in capital expenditures in 2025. To put that into perspective, I compared the net incomes of some popular companies, and when summed up, they still fall a little short of Meta's CAPEX investments. Here’s the breakdown:

* **Ford Motor Company (F)**: $3.53B
* **Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)**: $12.74B
* **IBM Corporation (IBM)**: $6.37B
* **Broadcom Inc. (AVGO)**: $5.49B
* **General Motors Company (GM)**: $10.93B
* **Visa Inc. (V)**: $19.74B

**Total**: \~**$59B**

What's even crazier is that Meta's planned spending is more than the trailing twelve months (TTM) net income of:

* **NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)**: $53.01B
* **Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)**: $49.87B

2025-01-30,Did You Buy Any Stocks On Monday?,"This post is kinda late but was just thinking, market was down on Monday. NVDA went down 17% and SPY was down like 2%.

Did you get into any shopping of stocks or etfs on the past Monday, 27 Jan? Or were you holding your cash as there's FOMC and JPow yesterday?

My case was, I nearly did wanna DCA more into NVDA at $118 but was also quite unsure if it would go down further due to Deepsake plus FOMC.

Of course PLTR was also in my list and it was a good price but NVDA was hard to miss on Monday.

In the end, I actually went with SCHG instead as I'm trying to increase my ETF portfolio even though I'm still a stock picker.

What's on your watchlist and did you get in on Monday? Thanks for sharing!",105,267
2025-01-31,When to exit (a short term position as somebody who usually invests long term)?,"Bought calls on NVDA and AVGO after the weekend Deep Seek-related dip. Seemed like free money. I'm usually more of an investor than a trader, so I didn't really have an exit plan going in.

As of now, they're both up more 20%. Each expires right after earnings in 4-5 weeks. There's probably some upside, but I don't know how to balance possible upside (and likelihood thereof) against taking profits so short term. 

Even in the unlikely event the underlyings explode up 50%, it won't be life changing money. I just want a sound, calculated plan so I'm not acting on impulse. Better late than never, right?

2025-02-03,Step 4 of 6 complete for Intel acquisition.,"Nvidia and Broadcom will be buying Intel at around 30$/share in a shared-use deal (like your wife).

Step 1. Nana 🕊🙏

The first news of acquisition was heard before the elections. This was step 2. The companies (NVDA and AVGO) preparing for a tighter (🫦) Foreign policy under a Trump administration.

Step 3. Trump won and Republicans hold the majority in the House and Senate.

Step 4. A Cheaper acquisition price needed to be established. No explanation necessary. Intel is down ""Bigly"".

Step 5. Nvidia met with Trump most likely regarding Stargate AND upcoming Tariffs. And Trump stood his ground. Questionable on his part considering his push on AI dominance,  but okay..?

Overall situation is that Nvidia and Broadcom will look to acquire Intel to avoid Tariffs while maintaining profit margins. And will obtain Intel at a steal of a price considering their 18A (1.8nm) process coming to maturity in H2 2025 ahead of TSMC's slightly larger and less advanced 2nm process. As well as their supposedly more efficient PowerVia technology. ""Intel is looking to fill all sockets"". I'm loading 2027 LEAPS. I will be buying/averaging 2 per month. See screenshot for position.

2025-02-03,NVDA: DeepSeek’s Disruption and the Changing Tech Landscape,"* Nvidia’s AI Market Dominance – Nvidia’s H100 and H800 GPUs are essential for AI workloads, powering models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, with major tech firms like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon relying on its chips.
* DeepSeek’s Disruptive Impact – DeepSeek’s AI model V3, trained on Nvidia’s H800 chips at a fraction of the usual cost, raises questions about the necessity of high-cost AI hardware, pressuring Nvidia’s pricing power.
* Financial and Competitive Pressures – Nvidia depends heavily on a few major tech companies, faces emerging competition from AMD, Broadcom, and DeepSeek, and has a valuation significantly above industry norms, making it vulnerable to market corrections.
* Nvidia’s AI Market Dominance – Nvidia’s H100 and H800 GPUs are essential for AI workloads, powering models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, with major tech firms like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon relying on its chips.
* DeepSeek’s Disruptive Impact – DeepSeek’s AI model V3, trained on Nvidia’s H800 chips at a fraction of the usual cost, raises questions about the necessity of high-cost AI hardware, pressuring Nvidia’s pricing power.

Nvidia has established itself as a dominant force in the AI hardware industry, with its H100 and H800 chips powering some of the most advanced AI models, including ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The H100’s architecture enables AI models to train at unprecedented speeds, while the H800 variant meets regulatory requirements in markets like China. The evolution from the A100 to the H100 has significantly accelerated AI capabilities, with GPT-3 models learning four times faster than before. Nvidia’s market strength is reinforced by deep integration with tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, ensuring continued demand for its products. As AI models become more sophisticated and data-intensive, Nvidia’s GPUs remain central to pushing the limits of what AI can achieve.

DeepSeek’s AI model V3 has disrupted the industry by achieving high-performance AI training on Nvidia’s H800 chips at significantly lower costs. Traditionally, training advanced AI models has required billions in investment, but DeepSeek’s approach challenges this assumption, demonstrating that high-level AI training can be done with minimal resources. This efficiency could lead major tech firms to question Nvidia’s high pricing, pressuring the company’s ability to maintain its premium margins. If DeepSeek’s success encourages more companies to seek cost-effective alternatives, Nvidia may need to justify its premium pricing or risk losing market share.

Despite its strong position, Nvidia’s financial foundation has key vulnerabilities. Nearly half of its data center revenue comes from a handful of major tech firms, including Microsoft and Meta—companies that are now investing in developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. While Nvidia’s dominance in both software and hardware makes it difficult to replace, emerging competitors like AMD and DeepSeek are introducing cost-effective alternatives. DeepSeek, for example, trained its model with only $5 million, a fraction of the billions typically required for Nvidia-powered training. With a P/E ratio three times the industry average, Nvidia’s valuation remains highly sensitive to changes in AI spending and broader market trends. A slowdown in AI-related investments or increased competition could significantly impact Nvidia’s stock price.

For years, Nvidia was synonymous with AI growth, with investors believing that any advancement in AI would translate directly into gains for Nvidia. However, this perception is shifting. The emergence of cost-effective AI models and alternative chip suppliers, including DeepSeek, AMD, Google, and Amazon, challenges Nvidia’s “There Is No Alternative” (TINA) status. Concerns about pricing, licensing restrictions, and geopolitical factors, including U.S. government restrictions on chip exports, further complicate Nvidia’s outlook. Investors are increasingly questioning whether Nvidia can sustain its premium pricing in a market where competition is growing, leading to potential valuation recalibration.

The AI industry is undergoing rapid transformation, with cost-efficiency becoming a critical factor in decision-making. Nvidia’s high-end GPUs have long been the gold standard, but rising costs are prompting companies to explore alternatives. AMD’s MI300 series, for example, offers competitive AI processing power at lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for firms looking to diversify suppliers. Broadcom is also gaining traction in AI networking, while DeepSeek’s focus on affordable AI chips threatens Nvidia’s dominance. As these competitors gain market share, Nvidia’s ability to maintain its pricing power and market stronghold may diminish, forcing it to adapt to a changing landscape.

DeepSeek’s advancements have ripple effects across the AI supply chain. If AI training costs continue to drop, tech giants may slow down their AI-related capital expenditures, impacting Nvidia’s growth trajectory. Furthermore, the shift toward more cost-efficient AI solutions could reduce demand for Nvidia’s high-end chips, altering market priorities from premium performance to affordability. This evolving landscape presents both risks and opportunities for Nvidia. While it may face increased competition, Nvidia’s leadership in AI infrastructure and software solutions still gives it a competitive edge. However, it must adapt to changing market demands to sustain long-term growth.

Nvidia’s market dominance is being challenged as the AI industry evolves. The rise of DeepSeek, along with increased competition from AMD, Broadcom, and major tech firms developing in-house chips, raises concerns about Nvidia’s pricing power and long-term growth. Recent market shifts have already led to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia’s market value, the largest single-day loss in U.S. stock history.

If the AI market prioritizes efficiency over expansion, Nvidia could see reduced demand for its high-end GPUs. However, its history of innovation, strong AI infrastructure, and ongoing R&D investments position it well to adapt. While some analysts view recent market dips as a buying opportunity, the competitive pressures and changing industry dynamics mean Nvidia must continue evolving to maintain its leadership in AI hardware.

# TL;DR: Nvidia remains a dominant force in AI hardware, but emerging competitors like DeepSeek, AMD, and Broadcom are challenging its pricing power and market dominance. DeepSeek’s AI model demonstrates that high-performance AI training can be achieved at significantly lower costs, potentially reshaping the AI ecosystem. Nvidia’s dependence on a few tech giants and its high valuation make it vulnerable to market shifts, while increasing competition suggests that its long-term growth may face headwinds. However, Nvidia’s innovation and market leadership still offer strong potential, provided it adapts to the evolving AI landscape.

2025-02-04,Is Broadcom (avgo) stock expected to fall due to the US tarrifs?,"I am wondering will the stock start falling and should I sell it? Seeing as there will be tariffs that are quite large on the chips from Taiwan, plus the other tariffs on Chine which makes up a huge part of the market of Broadcom?

2025-02-04,Step 4 of 6 complete for Intel acquisition.,"Nvidia and Broadcom will be buying Intel at around 30$/share in a shared-use deal (like your wife).

Step 1. Nana 🕊🙏

The first news of acquisition was heard before the elections. This was step 2. The companies (NVDA and AVGO) preparing for a tighter (🫦) Foreign policy under a Trump administration.

Step 3. Trump won and Republicans hold the majority in the House and Senate.

Step 4. A Cheaper acquisition price needed to be established. No explanation necessary. Intel is down ""Bigly"".

Step 5. Nvidia met with Trump most likely regarding Stargate AND upcoming Tariffs. And Trump stood his ground. Questionable on his part considering his push on AI dominance,  but okay..?

Overall situation is that Nvidia and Broadcom will look to acquire Intel to avoid Tariffs while maintaining profit margins. And will obtain Intel at a steal of a price considering their 18A (1.8nm) process coming to maturity in H2 2025 ahead of TSMC's slightly larger and less advanced 2nm process. As well as their supposedly more efficient PowerVia technology. ""Intel is looking to fill all sockets"". I'm loading 2027 LEAPS. I will be buying/averaging 2 per month. See screenshot for position.

2025-02-08,Marvell’s Investment Case Got Stronger With Hyperscaler Capex,"**I bought Marvell Technology (MRVL) for around $114 adding to my January purchases for around $107.**

I missed buying it in the low 90s, waiting to see if their transformation to an AI chip company was complete. Having a cyclical past with non-performing business segments made me hesitate, besides far too many promises have been made in the AI space only for investors to be disappointed.

Marvel has been walking the talk, Q3 results in Dec 2024 were exemplary, and guidance even better.

**Hyperscaler demand**

With a planned Capex of $105Bn for 2025, Amazon confirmed on their earnings call that the focus will continue on custom silicon and inferencing. Amazon and Marvell have a five-year, “multi-generational” agreement for Marvell to provide Amazon Web Services with the Trainium and Inferentia chips and other data center equipment. Amazon is an investor in Anthropic with plans to build a supercomputing system with “hundreds of thousands” of Trainium2 chips called Project Rainier. DeepSeek's model's success does suggest a further democratization of AI, as inference starts gaining prominence in 2026.

**Q3-FY2025**

Marvell beat revenue estimates by 4% and adjusted EPS estimates by 5.5%, 

FQ3 revenue grew 6.9% YoY and 19.1% QoQ growth to $1.52Bn, helped by a stronger-than-expected ramp of the AI custom silicon business.

For Q4, it expects revenue to grow 26.2% YoY and 18.7% QoQ to $1.8Bn at the midpoint, beating previous estimates by 9.1% and adjusted EPS estimates by 13.5%. 

Management indicated that it could exceed the full-year AI revenue target of $1.5Bn and likely beat the FY2026 AI revenue target of $2.5Bn as well.

Adjusted operating margin – 29.7% V 29.8% last year, and better than the management guide of 28.9% with even higher guidance for Q4 at 33%.

Adjusted net income – $373 Mn or 25% of revenue.

**Management has also committed to GAAP profitability in Q4**.

**Custom Silicon** **Could Boom** – There are estimates of a TAM (Total Addressable Market) of $42 billion for custom silicon by CY2028, of which Marvell could take 20% market share or $8Bn of the custom silicon AI opportunity. Broadcom too has talked up a potential TAM of $70Bn and I hope to see more details in the 4th quarter calls. On the networking side, the TAM is another $31 billion.

Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer thinks that each of Marvell’s four custom chips could achieve $1 billion in sales next year. Production is already ramping up on the Trainium chip for Amazon, along with the Axion chip for the Google unit of Alphabet. Another Amazon chip, the Inferentia, should start production in 2025. Toward the end of next year, deliveries will begin on Microsoft’s Maia-2, which Schafer hopes will achieve the largest sales of all.

**Key weaknesses and challenges**

Marvell carries $4Bn in legacy debt, which will weigh on its valuation.

The stock is already up 70% in the past year, and is volatile – it dropped $26 from $126 to $100 after the DeepSeek and tariffs scare, in the past ten days, before bouncing back.

Custom silicon, ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) have strong competition from the likes of Broadcom (AVGO) and everyone is chasing market leader Nvidia (NVDA). Custom silicon as the name suggests is not widely used like an Nvidia GPU and will encounter more difficult sales cycles and buying programs.  


Marvell has other segments, which account for 27% of the business that are not performing as well; but they’re going full steam ahead to focus on the custom silicon business and expect total data center to exceed 73% of revenue in the future. 

Drops in AI buying from data center giants will hurt Marvell.

Over 50% of Marvell’s revenue comes from China, and it could become a victim of a trade war.

**Valuation:** The stock is selling for a P/E of 43, with expected (as per consensus analysts' estimates) earnings growth of 80% in FY2025 and 30% after that for the next two years – that is reasonable. It has a P/S ratio of 12.6, with growth of 25%. It’s a bit expensive on the sales metric, but with AI taking an even larger share of the revenue pie, this multiple could increase.",0,16

Intel has struggled in advanced chip manufacturing, making it a potential acquisition target.

2025-02-17,"TSMC, Broadcom consider possible Intel deals to split chipmaker","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) rivals Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are considering deals that could split the troubled U.S. chipmaker into two, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Broadcom (AVGO) has been closely examining Intel's (INTC) chip design and marketing business, the report said, but will only make a bid if it can find a partner for Intel's (INTC) manufacturing business.

TSMC (TSM), the world's biggest contract chipmaker, has studied running all of Intel's (INTC) chip plants, either as part of an investor consortium or other structure, the report said.

The discussions with possible suitors and Trump administration officials, who are concerned about the company seen as crucial to national security, are being led by Intel's (INTC) executive chairman Frank Yeary, the report said.

According to the report, Yeary has been telling people close to him that he is focused on maximizing value for Intel (INTC) shareholders.

President Donald Trump's administration may not support Intel's (INTC) chip plants being run by a foreign player, Reuters reported Friday. While the White House supports foreign companies investing in the U.S., it is ""unlikely"" to support a foreign entity controlling Intel's (INTC) plants.

Bloomberg had earlier reported that TSMC (TSM) was evaluating acquiring a controlling stake in Intel's (INTC) factories at Trump's request.

Any deal for Intel (INTC) would require a signoff from the U.S. government, which has poured billions of dollars into Intel (INTC) under the Chips Act of 2022. The ailing chipmaker has been the largest beneficiary of the $53 billion program, receiving up to $7.9 billion to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and other locations in the U.S.

Intel (INTC) set up its foundry business under the leadership of former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who embarked on an ambitious turnaround plan. But Gelsinger was forced out of the company last year after the board reportedly lost confidence in him.

Intel (INTC), currently valued at $102.19 billion, has tumbled nearly 65% in the last five years. In comparison, TSMC's (TSM) current market capitalization stands at $840.25 billion and Broadcom's (AVGO) at $1.09 trillion.",82,35
2025-02-18,Can Broadcom save Intel? What to know about the latest deal rumors,"Intel Corp.’s future has been a hot topic on Wall Street lately, and it’s poised to stay that way into another week following a new report about possible deal activity.  
  
This time, it’s from The Wall Street Journal, which said that Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM) are looking separately at deals for different parts of Intel’s empire.

Intel and TSMC declined to comment. Broadcom didn’t immediately return MarketWatch’s request for comment.

Shares of Intel are up 5% in Tuesday’s premarket trading.

While there had already been speculation that TSMC was considering a move that would see it get more involved in Intel’s fabrication business, the new component in the reporting is the idea that Broadcom may be interested in Intel’s chip-design and marketing businesses.

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon is intrigued. “We want Broadcom to stay away from the fabs, but would love to see what they could do with the products,” he wrote in a Monday note to clients. Broadcom would likely be able to execute Intel’s x86 central-processing-unit business better than what Intel has been showing recently, he noted.

Broadcom has a history of cutting costs and boosting prices after making acquisitions, Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri said in a report.

* TSMC is exploring control over Intel’s Foundry business but requires U.S. regulatory approval.

Intel has been at the center of takeover speculation, with reports suggesting Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and Broadcom (AVGO) are looking to acquire parts of the company. These discussions, still in the early stages, could result in a joint venture or asset sale that restructures Intel’s operations.

TSMC, which previously distanced itself from Intel, is now exploring a joint venture for Intel’s Foundry business. The feasibility study focuses on acquiring Intel’s chip plants, particularly its 18A process node and proprietary PowerVia technology. However, such a deal would require U.S. government approval. Reports suggest that the Trump administration supports the move, with Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick involved in the discussions. If finalized, TSMC might lead a consortium of investors, including private equity firms and semiconductor companies, to structure the acquisition.

Broadcom has reentered the picture with an interest in Intel’s design assets. CEO Hock Tan is known for streamlining businesses after acquisitions, and he could reshape Intel’s design segment, likely keeping Data Center & AI assets while selling off other divisions. If Broadcom proceeds, a possible scenario could involve selling Intel’s Client design business to a company like Qualcomm. This would be similar to Broadcom’s strategy after acquiring VMware, where it divested non-core business units to focus on profitability.

Intel’s stock jumped 24% last week, marking its best weekly performance in over two decades. The company is currently valued at around $102.19 billion, trading close to its book value. However, despite the market optimism, there are risks that could derail these deals. Regulatory approval remains a major hurdle, and CHIPS Act restrictions require Intel to retain key control over any spun-off Foundry assets. If negotiations fail or the government shifts its stance, Intel’s stock could face downward pressure.

For now, the uncertainty surrounding these takeover discussions keeps Intel at a Hold rating. While a deal could unlock significant value, the complexity of regulatory approvals and deal structures makes it difficult to predict an outcome. Investors should remain cautious as discussions progress.

Intel is in takeover talks with TSMC and Broadcom, but regulatory and strategic hurdles make the outcome uncertain. Stock surged 24%, but risks remain, keeping it at a Hold rating.",2,0

2025-02-19,Intel shares pop 10% on report Broadcom and Taiwan Semi could break up company (Again),"Intel shares rallied more than 10% on Tuesday following a Wall Street Journal report that both Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are potentially weighing bids that could result in splitting the embattled chipmaker.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Broadcom may consider a play for the company’s chip design and marketing segment, citing people familiar with the matter, while TSMC is interested in a stake or complete control of Intel’s factories. The companies have not filed bids and talks are largely informal, the Journal reported.

The iconic American chipmaker’s stock has continued to sink lower in recent years, shedding billions in market value. Intel fell behind on the artificial intelligence tailwinds that have swept up the broader semiconductor sector.

* TSMC is exploring control over Intel’s Foundry business but requires U.S. regulatory approval.
* Broadcom is interested in Intel’s design assets, aligning with its growth strategy.

* Intel is in early discussions with TSMC and Broadcom for a potential joint venture or acquisition.
* TSMC is exploring control over Intel’s Foundry business but requires U.S. regulatory approval.

Intel has been at the center of takeover speculation, with reports suggesting Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and Broadcom (AVGO) are looking to acquire parts of the company. These discussions, still in the early stages, could result in a joint venture or asset sale that restructures Intel’s operations.

TSMC, which previously distanced itself from Intel, is now exploring a joint venture for Intel’s Foundry business. The feasibility study focuses on acquiring Intel’s chip plants, particularly its 18A process node and proprietary PowerVia technology. However, such a deal would require U.S. government approval. Reports suggest that the Trump administration supports the move, with Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick involved in the discussions. If finalized, TSMC might lead a consortium of investors, including private equity firms and semiconductor companies, to structure the acquisition.

Broadcom has reentered the picture with an interest in Intel’s design assets. CEO Hock Tan is known for streamlining businesses after acquisitions, and he could reshape Intel’s design segment, likely keeping Data Center & AI assets while selling off other divisions. If Broadcom proceeds, a possible scenario could involve selling Intel’s Client design business to a company like Qualcomm. This would be similar to Broadcom’s strategy after acquiring VMware, where it divested non-core business units to focus on profitability.

Intel’s stock jumped 24% last week, marking its best weekly performance in over two decades. The company is currently valued at around $102.19 billion, trading close to its book value. However, despite the market optimism, there are risks that could derail these deals. Regulatory approval remains a major hurdle, and CHIPS Act restrictions require Intel to retain key control over any spun-off Foundry assets. If negotiations fail or the government shifts its stance, Intel’s stock could face downward pressure.

For now, the uncertainty surrounding these takeover discussions keeps Intel at a Hold rating. While a deal could unlock significant value, the complexity of regulatory approvals and deal structures makes it difficult to predict an outcome. Investors should remain cautious as discussions progress.

2025-02-27,Self managed traditional IRA account with many small positions,"About a year ago, I took over my traditional IRA which had been professionally managed for a good while. It has a wide range of individual stocks like AAPL, AMD, AMZN, AVGO, AXP, BRKB, COST, CRM ... V, WBA, WMT (28 stocks and funds) for example, with share quantities ranging from 1 to 20+ for the individual stocks. Most, have really nice returns, but the quantity of each tends to be so small I question whether it would be wise to sell most and invest in a mix of SCHD, FXAIX, SCHG, FTEC, and FBGRX. I've already cleaned up a bunch of small quantity positions, but there are still a ton of them. I reinvested the proceeds into the funds above.

Would it make sense to sell most of these remaining small positions and concentrate those funds in selected ETFs and MFs as mentioned above? I've pretty much settled other Roth and IRA accounts into a mix of S&P 500, dividend ETFs, and growth funds. But this one account remains to be cleaned up and is worth around $135k-ish currently. 

I'm not generally a fan of bond funds, but do have about 6% in FXNAX. I've consolidated other stocks I sold into FXAIX and SCHD, about 27% and 29% respectively. And I put some in several growth funds too like FBGRX and FTEC, about 16% between them. So the remaining 20+ stocks comprise maybe 20-25% of the account. While I kinda like having BRKB, MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, META, etc., the share quantities are so low that I wonder if I would be better off selling them and reinvesting them in my core ETFs and MFs above. 

For the record, our current income is from Social Security, RMDs, and my wife who will likely work for 6 to 8 more years. I've been retired for years. The majority of our funds are in different Roth and 403b Roth and 403b IRA accounts. The account in question above is a rollover from a job years ago.",1,2

2025-03-03,Back testing- Is this too good to be true?,"So I run a back test on something I've been working in and it's results are pretty cool.

If we look at any tech company that made a move into the top 20 stocks by market cap in the S&P 500 since 1990 (when I started my back test) which wasn't already in the top 20 and put just £1000 on each one as soon as it was introduced these are the following stocks you would purchase aswell as the year of purchase and the rough price at the start of the year.

MSFT - 1991 @ $1.08
INTEL - 1992 @ $1.64
CISCO - 1996 @ $4.21
QUALCOMM - 1999 @ $4.20
ORACLE - 1999 @ $7.85
APPLE - 2007 @ $3.05
NVIDIA - 2020 @ $6.11
BROADCOM - 2021 @ $44.56

The results are roughly 4350% Since 1990 to 2025. 

On average that is a return of 120% (ish) per year. 

You put $1,000 in each one, only once in the January of that year, that's around $350,000 return. 

$8,000 to $350,000 is wild returns even if it is over 35 years.

2025-03-04,When will you taste the 🌈,"1. Stocks with High Short Interest:

High short interest indicates that a substantial number of investors are betting against a company’s stock, anticipating a price decline. Notable examples include:
	•	Enphase Energy (ENPH): This solar company has attracted significant bearish bets due to challenges from Chinese competition and high interest rates.  ￼
	•	Super Micro Computer (SMCI): Known for its high short interest, indicating potential investor skepticism.  ￼
	•	Albemarle (ALB): A lithium producer facing considerable short interest, possibly due to concerns over lithium market dynamics.  ￼
	•	Fox Corporation (FOXA): The media company has seen increased short positions, suggesting bearish sentiment.  ￼
	•	Moderna (MRNA): Despite its role in COVID-19 vaccine development, Moderna has experienced significant short interest, potentially due to uncertainties about future revenue streams.  ￼

2. Companies with Recent Earnings Misses:

Missing earnings expectations can lead to negative investor sentiment and potential stock price declines. Recent examples include:
	•	Crawford & Company B (CRD.B): Reported quarterly earnings of $0.19 per share, missing estimates of $0.24.  ￼
	•	Vistra (VST): Reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.14 per share, significantly below the expected $2.17.  ￼
	•	Deere & Company (DE): Reported a 30% decline in revenue and a 50% drop in net income for the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous year.  ￼
	•	Okta (OKTA): Released earnings that fell short of expectations by $0.48 per share.  ￼

3. Sector-Specific Challenges:

Certain sectors are facing headwinds that could impact stock performance:
	•	Semiconductor Industry: Companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have experienced recent corrections, and upcoming earnings reports from Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) could influence investor sentiment in the AI and semiconductor space.  ￼
	•	Australian Energy Sector: Companies such as Boss Energy Ltd (BOE) and Paladin Energy Ltd (PDN) are among the most shorted ASX shares, indicating potential vulnerabilities.  ￼

Cautionary Note:

Investing based on short-term predictions carries inherent risks. It’s essential to conduct thorough research and consider consulting a financial advisor before making investment decisions.

News: [Us Employment Report For February](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-07/us-employment-report-for-february)

**Ticker:** [**AVGO (Broadcom)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AVGO&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Earnings. Reported EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.49 exp, revenue of $14.92B vs. $14.61B expected. AVGO gave strong guidance of $14.9B vs $14.76B. Cited strong growth due to AI chips and/infrastructure components for training AI.

**Technicals:** Watching to see if we break $200 level today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** I think we're seeing the AI hype become more concentrated in the ""winners"" of the AI race now. There are some companies that ARE citing falling demand for their AI related products while others are stating that demand is still robust. Likely going to see greater consolidation in the future. Major chipmakers like Broadcom are benefiting from hyperscaler investments in AI over the 3 year AI boom.

**Risks:** Tariffs/supply chain constraints make the supply chain far more tenuous.

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, QCOM, all other semiconductor stocks

**Ticker:** [**LUNR (Intuitive Machines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** LUNR’s uncrewed Nova-C lander, Athena, encountered challenges upon landing on the Moon. (Something to do with their lunar lander not landing at the correct angle, I'm no rocket scientist.)

**Technicals:** LUNR sold off close to 40% yesterday, watching to see if we break the lows at $6.70 premarket. We had 3 major spikes (2 went to the lower) and I'm interested in seeing if we can make any form of recovery today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These exploratory spaceflight companies are insanely volatile and depend on their spaceflights doing well- as seen yesterday.

**Risks:** Technical malfunctions could impact investor confidence and future funding. Delays in future missions or failures in securing government contracts could also hinder growth.

**Related Tickers:** ASTS, RKLB

**Ticker:** [**WBA (Walgreens)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WBA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** WBA has agreed to a \~$10B deal with Sycamore Partners to take the company private. Deal is $11.45/shr in cash.

**Technicals:** We saw a strong spike from 10.60 -> 11.20 after the news.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Buyout play, but obviously there's not much reward left on this catalyst.

**Risks:** Deal could get cancelled, more delays, regulatory scrutiny, etc.

**Ticker:** [**HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HPE&p=d)

**Catalyst:** EPS of $0.49 vs. $0.49 expected. Revenue of $7.85B vs. $7.82B expected. HPE’s results were in line with expectations but they cited profit next year would be hurt by tariffs and had weak margins on server sales. Stated IT products from China and Mexico would affect the company’s outlook.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The IT hardware sector is facing supply chain disruptions and rising production costs due to tariff outlook. Easy rule of thumb: the more complex the product (advanced electronics), the more affected by tariffs they are.

**Technicals:** LUNR sold off close to 40% yesterday, watching to see if we break the lows at $6.70 premarket. We had 3 major spikes (2 went to the lower) and I'm interested in seeing if we can make any form of recovery today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These exploratory spaceflight companies are insanely volatile and depend on their spaceflights doing well- as seen yesterday.

**Risks:** Technical malfunctions could impact investor confidence and future funding. Delays in future missions or failures in securing government contracts could also hinder growth.

**Ticker:** [**WBA (Walgreens)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WBA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** WBA has agreed to a \~$10B deal with Sycamore Partners to take the company private. Deal is $11.45/shr in cash.

**Technicals:** We saw a strong spike from 10.60 -> 11.20 after the news.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Buyout play, but obviously there's not much reward left on this catalyst.

**Risks:** Deal could get cancelled, more delays, regulatory scrutiny, etc.

**Ticker:** [**HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HPE&p=d)

**Catalyst:** EPS of $0.49 vs. $0.49 expected. Revenue of $7.85B vs. $7.82B expected. HPE’s results were in line with expectations but they cited profit next year would be hurt by tariffs and had weak margins on server sales. Stated IT products from China and Mexico would affect the company’s outlook.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The IT hardware sector is facing supply chain disruptions and rising production costs due to tariff outlook. Easy rule of thumb: the more complex the product (advanced electronics), the more affected by tariffs they are.

2025-03-11,Tech megacaps lose over $750 billion in market cap in worst day for Nasdaq since 2022,"It’s gone from bad to worse for tech investors.

With the Nasdaq suffering its steepest drop since 2022 on Monday, the seven most valuable tech companies lost more than $750 billion in market value. Recession fears and concerns about a trade war drove the selloff.

Apple led the megacap losses, with its value plummeting by about $174 billion. Nvidia shaved off almost $140 billion in market value and shares closed down 5%. The leading AI chipmaker has lost nearly a third of its value just two months after notching a fresh high in January.

Tesla had the biggest percentage loss, with shares of the electric vehicle maker tumbling 15%, their worst day since 2020. The company has lost more than half its value since its stock price peaked in mid-December**.** The stock is also coming off its longest weekly losing streak in history as a public company.

Tesla lost $130 billion in value on Monday, while Microsoft and Alphabet lost $98 billion and $95 billion, respectively. Amazon lost $50 billion and Meta lost $70 billion.

Alphabet and Meta dropped more than 4% on Monday, while Microsoft and Amazon dropped at least 2% each. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell more than 4%, entering correction territory. Shares are more than 14% off their high.

Heavy selling intensified across the tech, with the Nasdaq falling to a six-month low. Many tech companies rely on parts and manufacturing overseas and new levies could push up prices. That’s also sparked worries of a U.S. recession, which Trump didn’t rule out over the weekend.

Semiconductor makers have also felt the pain, with the sector a primary target of new tariffs. Last week, the president announced an additional $100 billion investment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and called the company the “most powerful” in the world as he looks to boost domestic production.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF has plunged 3% over the past week and is down more than 16% since the inauguration. Heavy selling rattled the sector again Monday, with the ETF last down roughly 5%. Marvell Technology shed 8%, while ASML Holding and Micron Technology slumped more than 6% each. Broadcom fell 5%.

2025-03-12,AI trade simply out of juice or starting to deflate?,"The S&P 500 has had a stellar run for the past couple of years, adding roughly $19T from the ChatGPT moment (Nov '22) to the DeepSeek event (Jan '25). I ran some back of the envelope calculations and, by my estimate, at least half of that is AI-driven!

By AI-driven, I’m referring to two key contributors:

1. First, the ""picks and shovels"" plays in AI data centers, which contributed $4.5 trillion (24% of the S&P's gains), with NVDA leading the charge, accounting for 69% (nice) of this group's gains. While in my table I’ve focused on some of the major players in this space, it's likely I've left out many others, meaning these figures almost certainly underestimate the full impact.
2. Second, the rest of the Magnificent 7, which have benefited in various ways from the AI narrative, added an additional $5.2 trillion (27% of the S&P's gains).

Now, the big question is: Is the AI trade simply losing some juice, or are we witnessing the start of a full-blown reversal? Since the DeepSeek event, these names have collectively shed $1.3 trillion, suggesting the latter might not be easily dismissed.

What does this mean for the S&P going forward? The rest of the pack will have to pick up the slack if we are to see some gains this year, and that is without even considering the big R word.

Edit: figured out how to add the image.

2025-03-12,"TSMC pitched Intel foundry JV to Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom","TSMC (2330.TW), has pitched U.S. chip designers Nvidia (NVDA.O),, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), and Broadcom (AVGO.O), about taking stakes in a joint venture that would operate Intel's (INTC.O), factories, according to four sources familiar with the matter.

Under the proposal, the Taiwanese chipmaking giant would run the operations of Intel's foundry division, which makes chips adapted for the needs of customers, but it would not own more than 50%, the sources said. Qualcomm (QCOM.O), has also been pitched by TSMC, according to one of the sources and a separate source.

The talks, which are at an early stage, come after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration requested TSMC, the world's leading contract chipmaker, assist in turning around the troubled U.S. industrial icon, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.

The details of the plan for TSMC to take no more than a 50% stake and its overtures to potential partners are being reported for the first time.

Any final deal - the value of which is unclear - would need approval from the Trump administration, which does not want Intel or its foundry division to be fully foreign-owned, the sources said.

Intel, TSMC, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm declined to comment. The White House and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.

At stake is the future of the U.S. chipmaking giant, whose shares have lost more than half of their value in the last year.

Intel reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986, driven by large impairments. The foundry division's property and plant equipment had a book value of $108 billion as of December 31, according to a company filing.

Intel stock rose more than 7% in premarket U.S. trading on Wednesday, while Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm were up between 0.8% and 1.5%. TSMC closed about 1.8% higher in Taiwan.

Trump is keen to revive Intel's fortunes, as he seeks to boost American advanced manufacturing, three of the sources said.

The sources said TSMC's joint venture pitch was made to potential backers before the Taiwanese chipmaker announced with Trump on March 3 that the company planned to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that involves building five additional chip facilities there in coming years.

Talks about the joint venture over Intel's foundry division have since continued, the three sources said, with TSMC looking to have more than one chip designer as a partner.

Multiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division.

Qualcomm has exited earlier discussions to buy all or part of Intel, according to those people and a separate source.

Intel board members have backed a deal and held negotiations with TSMC, while some executives are firmly opposed, according to two sources.

Intel's contract manufacturing business, or foundry division, was a crucial part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to save Intel. Gelsinger was forced out by the board in December, which named two interim co-CEOs who have mothballed its forthcoming AI chip.

Any deals between historical rivals TSMC and Intel would face major challenges and be costly and laborious. The two companies currently use vastly different processes, chemicals, and chipmaking tool setups at their factories, according to separate sources at the companies.

Intel has previously had manufacturing partnerships with Taiwan's UMC (2303.TW), and Israel's Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA), that could offer a precedent for the two companies to operate together, but it remains unclear how such a partnership would work regarding trade manufacturing secrets.

The Taiwanese chipmaker wants potential investors in the joint venture to also be Intel advanced manufacturing customers, according to one of the sources.

Reuters reported last week, citing sources, that Nvidia and Broadcom are running manufacturing tests with Intel, using the company's most advanced production techniques, known as 18A. AMD is also evaluating whether Intel's 18A manufacturing process is suitable for it.

But 18A has been an area of contention in negotiations between Intel and TSMC, two sources said. During talks in February, Intel executives told TSMC that its advanced 18A manufacturing technology was superior to TSMC's 2-nanometer process, according to those sources.

2025-03-26,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead.

Nvidia Stock Is Falling. Not Even Chip Exemption Saves It From Broad Slump.

2:28 PM-Apr 3

NVDA

By Adam Clark

Nvidia looks set to fall sharply following President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports to the U.S. The chip maker escaped specific levies but the wider market reaction and fears of Chinese retaliation are set to drag on the shares.

Nvidia shares were down 3.2% at $106.93 in the Thursday premarket having tumbled 5.7% at $104.15 in after-hours trading. The stock rose 0.3% during Wednesday's session.

The tariff announcement wasn't quite as bad as it could have been for Nvidia. Trump said the levy on imports for Taiwan - where Nvidia's chips are mostly manufactured - will be set at 32%. However, the White House published a fact sheet after Trump's announcement that said semiconductors would not be subject to that reciprocal tariff.

That doesn't mean chip tariffs are off the table entirely. Products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and lumber will be addressed separately, a senior administration official said.

The other major concern is likely to be potential retaliation from Beijing, with Chinese goods now facing total duties of 54% after the latest tariff announcements.

Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.8% in after-hours trading and Broadcom was down 6.3%.

Meanwhile, Nvidia on Wednesday said its Blackwell computing platform set performance records in tests for inferencing - the process of generating output from Al models - carried out by MLCommons, an open engineering consortium.

There has been speculation over whether Nvidia's dominant position in Al chips would weaken as the focus shifts from training Al models to inference. The company has pushed back hard against that, noting inference makes up around 40% of its data-center revenue and is growing fast. It says that its NVL72 server system delivers a fourfold improvement in Al model training but up to a 30 times improvement in inference compared with previous systems.

2025-04-04,"Apple sheds $300 billion in tariff-fueled sell-off, on track for worst drop since March 2020","[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sheds-300-billion-in-tariff-fueled-sell-off-on-track-for-worst-drop-since-march-2020-175727479.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sheds-300-billion-in-tariff-fueled-sell-off-on-track-for-worst-drop-since-march-2020-175727479.html)

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",212,62

> The board has authorized the repurchase through Dec. 31, Broadcom said in a statement Monday. The announcement sent the company’s shares up about 3% in late trading.

> The stock had been down 34% this year through the close of regular New York trading, part of a broader tech rout fueled by tariff concerns.

> The buyback “reflects the board’s confidence in the strength of Broadcom’s diversified semiconductor and infrastructure software product franchises,” Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said in the statement.

2025-05-09,Palantir now among 10 most valuable U.S. tech companies — its earnings multiple is astronomical,"There’s a new member in the list of the top 10 U.S. technology companies by market cap.

Data analytics software vendor Palantir jumped about 8% on Thursday, bringing its valuation to $281 billion. That puts it ahead of Salesforce, which closed at a $268 billion and had previously been ranked tenth. Palantir surpassed legacy tech giants Cisco and IBM earlier this year.

Microsoft tops the market cap list at $3.3 trillion, followed by Apple and Nvidia.

Palantir’s induction follows a dramatic rally in the stock price, which has more than quintupled in value over the last year. The shares have jumped 58% in 2025, positioning Palantir to be the top S&P 500 performer for a second year. The stock has been a major outlier in recent months, continuing to pop while its tech peers have been weighed down by tariff uncertainty and fears of an economic slowdown.

The Nasdaq is down 7% this year even after bouncing back some over the past three weeks.

Palantir, founded in 2003 by a group that included Peter Thiel, the company’s chairman, and CEO Alex Karp, has benefitted from a booming government business, which grew 45% to $373 million last quarter. That includes a $178 million contract to build artificial intelligence-enabled systems for the U.S. Army.

In an aminated shareholder letter attached to the company’s earnings report, Karp applauded his company’s controversial defense business and suggested that some former critics in Silicon Valley have “turned a corner and begun following our lead.”

“We note only that our commitment to building software for the U.S. military, those whom we have asked to step into harm’s way, remains steadfast, when such a commitment is fashionable and convenient and when it is not,” Karp wrote.

But investors who want in on the action have to pay up, because while Palantir has joined the top tech ranks by market cap, it’s a far smaller company in terms of sales and profit. Salesforce, the cloud software company that it just leapfrogged, generated over 10 times more revenue than Palantir in the past year, and is expected to do so again over the next four quarters.

That all means Palantir has multiples that are much higher than its large-cap tech peers. Palantir currently trades for 520 times trailing earnings, almost 200 times forward earnings, and 90 times revenue.

“Fundamentals are clearly alive, but we think irrational valuation,” wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies, in a note on May 6. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock.

Among the 10 other top tech names, including Salesforce, the average trailing price-to-earnings multiple is about 58, and it’s only that high because Broadcom and Tesla are both around 160. For forward earnings, the average multiple is roughly 37.5, inflated by Tesla’s 137 figure. And for revenue, the average multiple is 10.2, with Nvidia carrying the highest premium at 22.

Palantir shares slumped more than 12% on Tuesday following first-quarter results. The company topped revenue estimates but showed a deceleration in international commercial sales that spooked some investors. Accelerating growth expectations have also left the company with a high bar to clear.

“You don’t have to buy our shares,” Karp told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan on Wednesday. “We’re happy. We’re going to partner with the world’s best people and we’re going to dominate. You can be along for the ride or you don’t have to be.”

**Jobs Report Comes As Fed Faces Pressure on Interest Rates**  
The scheduled Friday release of the May U.S. jobs report will show whether the labor market continues to exhibit strength after employers added more jobs than analysts expected in April, as the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%.

Trump has been applying pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates from their current levels of 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed officials have said that they are in “wait-and-see” mode as the labor market remains strong and inflation comes under pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Earlier in the week, market watchers will get updates on job openings, private-sector payrolls, and weekly jobless claims.

Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dallas Fed President Logan, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, and Philadelphia Fed President Harker. On Wednesday, the Fed’s Beige Book will provide more details on economic conditions throughout the country.

The Thursday scheduled report on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariff threats have pushed shippers to increase imports ahead of the expected import taxes.

Investors will also be watching manufacturing and services industry surveys scheduled for release this week, as well as updated data on consumer credit levels, factory orders, and construction spending.

**Tech, Retail Earnings Reports in Focus**  
Chipmaker Broadcom’s scheduled financial report, due Thursday, comes on the heels of industry leader Nvidia’s (NVDA) report last week that showed continued demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. Broadcom reported a 77% jump in its AI-related revenue in its most recent financial release as company executives forecast continued growth in that sector.

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings is expected to release its earnings on Tuesday. The firm said in early May that it planned to cut 5% of its workforce. Guidewire Software, which provides services to insurance providers, is also expected to deliver an update on its AI products Tuesday.

Logistics software provider Descartes Systems Group is expected to release its earnings on Wednesday. Shippers continue to grapple with the impact of Trump's tariffs on the supply chain.

With consumer sentiment surveys showing increasing concerns over economic conditions, investors will be watching reports from retailers for signals on spending. Scheduled reports from Dollar General on Tuesday and Dollar Tree and Five Below on Wednesday will provide a look at consumer traffic at those stores. Campbell’s scheduled report on Monday will shine a light on food spending, while fashion brands Lululemon and Calvin Klein parent PVH also will be reporting.

Other noteworthy reports this week include Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, a competitor to Tesla in that country, and information technology provider Hewlett Packard Enterprise.",414,85

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings is expected to release its earnings on Tuesday. The firm said in early May that it planned to cut 5% of its workforce. Guidewire Software, which provides services to insurance providers, is also expected to deliver an update on its AI products Tuesday.

Logistics software provider Descartes Systems Group is expected to release its earnings on Wednesday. Shippers continue to grapple with the impact of Trump's tariffs on the supply chain.

With consumer sentiment surveys showing increasing concerns over economic conditions, investors will be watching reports from retailers for signals on spending. Scheduled reports from Dollar General on Tuesday and Dollar Tree and Five Below on Wednesday will provide a look at consumer traffic at those stores. Campbell’s scheduled report on Monday will shine a light on food spending, while fashion brands Lululemon and Calvin Klein parent PVH also will be reporting.

Other noteworthy reports this week include Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, a competitor to Tesla in that country, and information technology provider Hewlett Packard Enterprise.",414,85

**Jobs Report Comes As Fed Faces Pressure on Interest Rates**  
The scheduled Friday release of the May U.S. jobs report will show whether the labor market continues to exhibit strength after employers added more jobs than analysts expected in April, as the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%.

Trump has been applying pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates from their current levels of 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed officials have said that they are in “wait-and-see” mode as the labor market remains strong and inflation comes under pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Earlier in the week, market watchers will get updates on job openings, private-sector payrolls, and weekly jobless claims.

Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dallas Fed President Logan, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, and Philadelphia Fed President Harker. On Wednesday, the Fed’s Beige Book will provide more details on economic conditions throughout the country.

The Thursday scheduled report on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariff threats have pushed shippers to increase imports ahead of the expected import taxes.

Investors will also be watching manufacturing and services industry surveys scheduled for release this week, as well as updated data on consumer credit levels, factory orders, and construction spending.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

2025-06-03,Broadcom Introduces Latest Networking Chip to Accelerate Artificial Intelligence,"Broadcom Corp. said on Tuesday that it has begun shipping its latest networking chip designed to accelerate artificial intelligence.

The chip, called Tomahawk 6, doubles the performance of its predecessor and has other traffic control features that make the networking chip significantly more efficient, Ram Velaga, Broadcom's senior vice president, said in an interview with Reuters on Monday.

The increase in speed means fewer network switches are needed to perform the same tasks, Viraga said.

Broadcom's networking chips are becoming increasingly important because of artificial intelligence. In building the data centers needed for AI applications, infrastructure builders must string together hundreds or even thousands of chips.

Building large-scale clusters of networking chips requires specialized networking devices and chips, of which the Tomahawk family of processors is one.

With the Tomahawk 6, Broadcom's engineers have increased its speed and functionality to the point where it can be used to build the larger data centers needed for AI, which can daisy-chain more than 100,000 graphics processors (GPUs), Viraga said.

In a few years, he said, “you'll see a million GPUs housed in one physical building.”

Broadcom's networking chips use the Ethernet networking protocol, which has been a networking standard for decades. NVIDIA makes hardware that uses technology from its competitor InfiniBand, as well as several Ethernet-based products.

“All of these networks can be implemented very simply over Ethernet without the need for esoteric technology,” Velaga said.

The Tomahawk 6 is the first product in the series to combine multiple chipsets into a single package, a technology known as “chiplets” that has been widely adopted by other chip design companies such as AMD. Velaga said the addition of chiplets roughly doubles the amount of silicon area used in a design. Velaga said the addition of the chiplet roughly doubled the area of silicon used in the design.

Broadcom is using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's three-nanometer process to produce Tomahawk switches.",16,2

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, & Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, & Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..

**Quantum Computing:**

\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.

**Smart Phones:**

\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time

**Streaming / Ads:**

\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \- Competing with Meta and Netflix

**Smart Home / Wearables:**

\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.

**Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**

\------***Waymo, Wing*** \- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*

**AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**

\------*Verily, & Calico* \- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.

\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.

\-

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

*Price Target long term - 200+*

thanks for getting this far into my regarded ted talk, give it a chance!",554,239

2025-06-20,Thoughts on investment strategy,"Hi everyone, 

I'm 39/m, living in Europe, with inherited US dollars in a Schwab international account, so I cannot invest in mutual funds or ETFs, only individual stocks and bonds. Initially I bought multiple US treasuries with various maturity dates from 2025-2032, just to avoid having to think about it. Then, about a year ago, I started investing 750$/month in 15 individual stocks via Schwab's ""stock slices"" service (so 50$ per stock per month), thus slowly increasing the stocks percentage as bonds start maturing and freeing cash. Since I can't just buy a S&P500-ETF, my idea was to represent it with these 15 stocks, focusing mostly on growth/tech, with a few defensive dividend positions as well, and avoiding big finance, fossile energy and defense industry (just personal preference). I'd be curious to hear what people think of my picks: 

Apple / Microsoft / Nvidia / Broadcom / Adobe / PaloAlto Networks / ServiceNow / Merck / Abbvie / Vertex Pharmaceuticals / Procter&Gamble / NextEra Energy / MainStreet Capital / Realty Income REIT / WasteManagement 

I realize scientifically speaking ""time in the market beats timing the market"", but I just feel more comfortable psychologically with the approach of slowly building the stock portion, as opposed to just buying lump sums of all these stocks at one random moment. 

Any thoughts or improvement ideas would be appreciated! ",5,11

2025-06-24,What stock do you believe in today that others might regret sleeping on in 5 years?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been thinking a lot about those stocks that people believed in early, like Palantir, Tesla, or even Nvidia, and how much they paid off for early investors who held on.

What companies are you currently bullish on for the long term? I’m talking about the ones that you truly believe could grow into something huge in the next 5–10 years, even if they’re small now or not yet mainstream.

I’m not necessarily looking for the next meme stock or short-term swing trades, more the ones that you see potential in based on fundamentals, vision, or tech.

2025-06-25,Why Qualcomm’s Latest Price Target Can’t Be Ignored,"As we head into the final week of June, **Qualcomm** continues to test investors’ patience. Even with a fundamentally solid earnings report in April and a tidy 25% gains since then, the tech giant is failing to ignite the kind of sustained uptrend seen in bigger peers like **NVIDIA** or **Broadcom**. Shares have been drifting downwards for nearly two weeks, though Monday’s 1% gain showed some welcome strength. The uptrend that began in April is technically still intact, but only just.

This lack of momentum has been especially frustrating given Qualcomm’s healthy diversification across handsets, automotive, and the Internet of Things (IoT), not to mention its recent M&A activity.

And yet, analyst coverage has been sparse in comparison to other major chipmakers. That’s why last week’s update from Bank of America can’t be ignored.

# Bank of America Sees at Least 30% Upside

Bank of America’s research team, led by Tal Liani,reiterated its Buy rating on Qualcomm, though it trimmed its price target from $245 to $200. It’s a noteworthy move, while they’ve tempered expectations, they still see roughly 30% upside from where the stock closed on Monday.

Their reasoning was clear. As we mentioned above, Qualcomm’s Q2 earnings were solid, with the numbers coming in ahead of analyst expectations pretty much across the board. Its QCT segment, which includes the company’s core chip business, and its Handsets did especially well, while Automotive and IOT were both impressive too.

# Potential Headwinds for Qualcomm

The problem, though, according to Bank of America, is that some of its sales trends are showing signs of stagnation. As **Apple** , one of Qualcomm’s key customers, continues to bring more and more of its manufacturing in-house, Bank of America now expects its contribution to headset sales to fall sharply and potentially disappear altogether. That’s a huge headwind for a company still heavily dependent on smartphone cycles.

Still, they believe Qualcomm’s AI PCs and data center growth can offset some of the drag, though the company is lacking any near-term catalysts that could spark renewed bullishness. All that being said, however, their updated $200 target reflects a 15x multiple on their 2026 earnings estimate, which keeps Qualcomm looking extremely cheap relative to the sector. The stock’s current forward P/E sits below 14, in stark contrast to NVIDIA’s 46.

These risks aren’t new, but taken together, they help explain why the stock has struggled to build lasting momentum. The Bank of America team could easily have downgraded the stock to a Hold, but they didn’t, and investors should take confidence from that.

And with the stock trading at a highly unusual discount to its peers from a valuation standpoint, you can’t help but feel there’s a bargain to be had here - you might just have to wait a little longer than is ideal for the payoff.

# Watch the Chart

From a technical standpoint, Qualcomm is approaching an inflection point. Last week’s update would have helped spur some bullish interest, but the stock has been effectively trending down for the past fortnight. Crucially, the MACD just completed a bearish crossover, and momentum could turn negative if shares don’t start rallying north soon.

Given the S&P 500 index is on the verge of an all-time record close, bulls will want to see Qualcomm move back towards $160 this week, which would mean it avoids setting a lower low and risking a breakdown of the uptrend.

As AI and edge computing continue to drive long-term demand, stocks like QCOM, AVGO, MAAS, MSFT, MU, and TXN could benefit from renewed infrastructure and device-side innovation, especially in areas like IoT and automotive connectivity.

For investors willing to stomach some near-term volatility, Qualcomm offers an intriguing mix of value, optionality, and a long-term AI tailwind. The latest analyst commentary should serve as a reminder that while the potential mightn’t be as bright as some others out there, it’s far from lost. But unless shares can shake off the lethargy and recapture momentum soon, it may take another upside surprise to get the stock firing again.",0,5
2025-06-25,How to find peace with my investment?,"I've always been frustrated with active investing. I've beaten myself up for not making best decisions and it got me very depressed and irritated even though I am kinda profitable. I feel like I have never done enough research about the companies. I am constantly anxious about my portfolio. Which stocks should I hold? How should I manage the position? Therefore, I tried to study on various technical analysis trading strategies and try a lot of algo trading strategies so that I can have a fully mechanic system to make decision. Then I found that it is very difficult to beat s&p 500. Even if I can do it I think it's not worth the effort because the excess return is not that much and I can not guarantee that the system will consistently outperform the market so it's still walking on thin ice and still kind of discrteional because I need to make decisions on adjusting the strategy.

So two year ago I decided that I should just buy and hold the stock market index and get rid of all the stress. But I was not satisfied with 8\~10% return and thought that I could leverage my exposure and made use of this opportunity after a bear market in 2022. It worked great until this april. I grew my account from 80k to 800k in two years (included my salary income). My basic strategy is to hold 3\~4x leverage broad market future and will add more if there is a bit of correction (like 2023/12 and 2024/8). I planned to stop at 2M net worth so with 4x leverage it's another (2M/800k-1)/4\*100%=37.5% and I'll be set. This april I blew up my account because I added on the way down and ended up overleveraged and got margin called. I went from 800k to less than 50k and realized that it's not really a sustainable strategy. Well, deep down I knew it's not sustainable but I wanted to make use of this post-2022 bull market cycle to the fullest because I hate investing so much that I want to make money faster and then sit with 5\~8% return for the rest of my life.

After this incident, I return to steady investment and am considering go back to active investing and trading. Currently I just hold SPY, QQQ, and NVDA. But I find that I beat myself up for taking profits too early or not buying more or not buying any other rallying stock like AVGO, AMD, and a ton of others. I get really mad to the point it affects every aspect of my life. Sometimes I think to myself is it really worth it if investing makes me financially successful but ruin my overall life. I am looking for any suggestion. Much appreciated.

PS. I want to clarify that I am not sharing my story to just rant about my tramatized experience but to explain my thought process and show that I've tried many approaches in investing and that I've always tried very very hard to outperform the market.

As AI and edge computing continue to drive long-term demand, stocks like QCOM, AVGO, MAAS, MSFT, MU, and TXN could benefit from renewed infrastructure and device-side innovation, especially in areas like IoT and automotive connectivity.

For investors willing to stomach some near-term volatility, Qualcomm offers an intriguing mix of value, optionality, and a long-term AI tailwind. The latest analyst commentary should serve as a reminder that while the potential mightn’t be as bright as some others out there, it’s far from lost. But unless shares can shake off the lethargy and recapture momentum soon, it may take another upside surprise to get the stock firing again.",0,5

2025-06-28,Google Cloud’s OpenAI Deal “A Win for TPU Chips” Microsoft Partner Says: CRN,"https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2025/google-cloud-s-openai-deal-a-win-for-tpu-chips-microsoft-partner-says

Make no mistake, this is also a win for Google Cloud against Microsoft Azure,” says one Microsoft partner top executive. ‘[OpenAI] has continued, all year long, to loosen its dependency on Microsoft.

“Hats off to Google. They made the right R&D moves to win over a customer with lots of money to spend,” said the executive.

Google has its own DeepMind AI lab that competes directly against OpenAI around developing large language models (LLMs) for AI customers.

“[OpenAI] will be spending a ton of money on Google. They have $10 billion in sales. There’s money to be made here by Google,” the solution provider executive said. “We’re a big Azure shop, but I can see Google making some headwinds with its chips and cloud business overall because of the money they’re going to make on OpenAI. ... But we’re still big believers that Microsoft will be the leader in the AI era.”

I’m a huge Google bull. I see AI as a naturally oligopolistic industry. Multiple winners are possible. Google will lose in some areas, but win in others. 

However, you need the full stack. Google has the full stack. The Hardware, The Software, The Data, The Network, The Capital, and The Employees. No one else has it all. And it’s working. 

https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-convinces-openai-use-tpu-chips-win-nvidia

If Google fails at AI, that would be a tale for the ages about innovator’s dilemma. They have everything they need to win. I’m of the belief that Google Execs see the challenge.

2025-07-10,$POET -- THE 10 BAGGER YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT,"If you've been on WSB for any time at all, you've read a new DD and thought, ""This guy is a moron; his play will never work""—only to check the ticker a couple weeks later and see it's already up over 100%. This is your chance to right that wrong and make a shit ton of money in the process.

**SKIP THIS PART IF RETARDED:**

Thanks to NVDA and Co, computer chips are faster than ever. The problem? Electronic data transmission can't keep up. Because of thermodynamics, the fastest that data can effectively be electronically transmitted at the chip level is around 100Gbps-ish. In order to maximize the power of those NVDA chips companies pay millions for, they'll HAVE TO switch to photonics (data transmission using light). Okay, so who is making this technology? A lot of companies (Broadcom, Mitsubishi, Foxconn, Lumentum, etc). The tricky part is converting between electronic data from the chips and photonic data from the transmission modules. This is where POET Technologies comes in (here is their website, if you want to try to better understand what they do: [POET](https://www.poet-technologies.com/))

POET is incredibly well-positioned for the inevitable photonics boom. Their partners include Foxconn, Mitsubishi, Celestial AI, Luxshare, Adtran, Mentech, and Lessengers. POET will supply these companies with Optical Interposers that they will add to their Optical Modules. Those companies will sell those Optical Modules to AI data centers, cloud computing, telecom, etc. Diagram for the mentally impaired:

https://preview.redd.it/nxasurdroxbf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54fa88c56f66e8992752794c69041ccfc47ad597

Now, POET is a pre-revenue company. However, the switch from electronic to photonic chip-level data transmission is happening *as we speak*. And so, the single most important statement of this entire DD: **POET WILL START SHIPPING ORDERS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND MAKING SIGNIFICANT REVENUE WITHIN THE NEXT MONTHS, WEEKS, OR DAYS.** The reason why this hasn't already started is because the customers in the final step of the diagram need to wait 6-9 months to test-run the technology before finalizing their orders -- standard practice in the industry ([Source](https://agoracom.com/ir/POETTechnologies/forums/discussion/topics/809555-OFC-Summary/messages/2434913?entity=thread&view=thread)). In other words, the orders have ALREADY BEEN PLACED, and everyone is simply waiting for the tests to conclude to actually start fulfilling them: ""In fact, \[Rep. from POET customer\] stated that they already have a large hyperscaler customer who has placed orders for the solution."" [(](https://agoracom.com/ir/POETTechnologies/forums/discussion/topics/809555-OFC-Summary/messages/2434913?entity=thread&view=thread)[Source](https://agoracom.com/ir/POETTechnologies/forums/discussion/topics/809555-OFC-Summary/messages/2434913?entity=thread&view=thread)).

With such a small market cap, a skeptic might wonder how POET would be able to defend their valuable position in the industry. First, they have a shit ton of patents for their technology ([Source](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/poet-technologies-inc)). Additionally, their various partners/customers have incorporated POET's technology into a wide variety of transmission speeds: 400Gbps, 800Gbps, 1.6Tbps, and even 3.2Tbps. Right now, 1.6T and 3.2T are not needed in the vast majority of cases. However, as companies require faster and faster data transmission in the coming years, they'll still be buying optical modules with POET's tech inside. Because of this, I cannot reiterate enough how well-positioned POET is to capitalize on the AI / data center boom.

**IF RETARDED, START READING HERE:**

Knowing that POET will start making money hand-over-fist in the near future, the next step is to calculate how much they could actually make. Taken from their Q4 2024 earnings report:

""Established a major wafer-level assembly and test facility for optical engines in Penang, Malaysia with the signing of several agreements with Globetronics Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd., a leading semiconductor manufacturer and contractor, equipping Globetronics with the capacity to manufacture an initial **1 million POET optical engines annually**."" ([Source](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-financial-results))

But that's not all. They recently made another manufacturing agreement for even more production, expected to be ready in 1 to 2 quarters:

""POET Technologies has signed a manufacturing agreement with NationGate Solutions in Malaysia to produce optical engine assemblies, enhancing its manufacturing capabilities and **addressing growing customer demand**."" ([Source](https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/poet-technologies-expands-manufacturing-with-nationgate-in-malaysia))

Because the Globetronics facility is already up and running ([Source](https://x.com/POETtech/status/1938241918712090821)), I'll be conservative and use the production numbers from that facility alone. Again, being conservative, I'll average the 400G and 800G optical units at $250 a pop. 1M units \* $250 / unit is $250M. Multiply that by a P/S ratio of 10, and you get a market cap of $2.5B -- representing a **5X** from the current market cap of $500M. And that revenue is going to start pouring in any day. But let's get crazy and estimate what this could be 3 years in the future. 3M units \* $500 / unit (accounting for 1.6T, 3.2T being more expensive) \* 10 P/S ratio = $15B market cap -- **30X upside** from current share price.

The best part about this situation? Wall Street doesn't care enough about pre-revenue microcaps to understand POET's potential. Once institutions take the time to understand POET's position in a rapidly burgeoning industry, this thing will practically double overnight (And yes, I know that it's already up over 50% from the recent lows. I posted this as soon as this got above the $500M mkt cap requirement).

https://preview.redd.it/gfcstni4cybf1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4e5793fb2e02108aa0b06dc6a1f7434d0c9df55

If this stock gets ANY sort of public attention, the market will quickly re-price its valuation. Coupled with the incoming slew of positive news (fulfilled purchase orders, revenue, new products, etc), this has the potential to go on a crazy run. The only caveat is that I can't tell you when exactly this could happen. POET's CEO has reiterated that H2 2025 will bring revenue -- I'd guess orders start getting announced before September. That doesn't mean you should go and buy calls expiring in a month, though.

https://preview.redd.it/n8yvi1vq6ybf1.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7336f25c19e73565ad46e676de4dd2981ecbbc3

The easiest way to play this is to buy shares and chill -- I am almost certain that POET will at least double by the end of the year. If you happen to be a degenerate gambler and are morally against buying shares -- go for 1/16/26 or 1/15/27 10c. The options chain is stupidly bullish, and it could easily gamma squ\*eze if the share price continues to go up and degenerates continue buying OTM calls.

https://preview.redd.it/1c0jwnvt7ybf1.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a1f8fa4fe4b1f09fdb7837a6ccd1d25b5f4338c

My base case is $12/share by EOY, and $30/share by Q3 2026. My optimistic case is $30/share by EOY, and $45-60/share (3.75B to 5B mkt cap) by Q3 2026. We could easily see $60 or higher sooner than that if you get hype and news at the right time.

**TL;DR** \-- POET, a $500M mkt cap photonics company, is on the cusp of generating significant revenue. Think of the potential for an immediate 5X return, minimum. The market is largely unaware of this stock, and it will undergo a dramatic re-pricing in the coming weeks and months. Buy into the next multi-bagger BEFORE it happens.

**Position:**

EDIT: Initially forgot about this, but they've won a bunch of awards for their technology. Doesn't really mean much for share price, but it's evidence that this whole thing isn't vaporware.

2025-07-11,Trump posted: ‘The stock market is at an all-time high and interest rates should be cut immediately’!,"Former U.S. President Donald Trump just posted heavy rhetoric on social media, praising tech, industrial stocks and cryptocurrencies for their big gains and strongly calling on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Let's break down what he said and analyze the current state of the market with the latest data. Tech stocks, industrial stocks, Nasdaq hit record highs, cryptocurrencies “break through the sky” Nvidia (NVDA) is up 47% since the tariffs, the U.S. made hundreds of billions of dollars from the tariffs the country came back and called on the Fed to immediately cut interest rates declaring that “there is no inflation” .

How does the market interpret this?

Expectations for rate cuts are heating up: inflation is falling back + political heat is rising in a campaign year, Trump's statement may create some public pressure on the Fed (although its independence remains).

Tariffs negative turned positive? : Despite initial concerns that the market was under pressure, from the perspective of capital rotation, industrial, AI and defense stocks have risen, and it seems that the “Made in the USA” narrative is stronger.

Nvidia became a symbol: as the AI concept leader, NVDA after the tariffs rose against the trend, became the representative of the “no fear of policy uncertainty”, ARM, SMCI, AVGO, etc. also strengthened, the whole AI plate into the “revaluation period”.

Follow-up possible trend?

If the next Fed officials do not rush to suppress the rate cut expectations, the market may be the following scenarios

 Long beneficiary direction: tech giants (NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL), interest rate sensitive growth stocks (ARKK, SMH), industrial/infrastructure stocks (CAT, DE, GE)

Risks to watch out for: QQQ/SPY technicals are close to overheating, Powell or other officials release hawkish letters, earnings season is approaching, and there could be a “positive cash-out-on-decline” 

What do our Reddit friends think?

Do you think Trump is just “rubbing it in” or is the impact of his policies really being priced into the market?

Will the Fed turn dovish under this political pressure?

Nvidia became a symbol: as the AI concept leader, NVDA after the tariffs rose against the trend, became the representative of the “no fear of policy uncertainty”, ARM, SMCI, AVGO, etc. also strengthened, the whole AI plate into the “revaluation period”.

Follow-up possible trend?

If the next Fed officials do not rush to suppress the rate cut expectations, the market may be the following scenarios

 Long beneficiary direction: tech giants (NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL), interest rate sensitive growth stocks (ARKK, SMH), industrial/infrastructure stocks (CAT, DE, GE)

Risks to watch out for: QQQ/SPY technicals are close to overheating, Powell or other officials release hawkish letters, earnings season is approaching, and there could be a “positive cash-out-on-decline” 

What do our Reddit friends think?

Do you think Trump is just “rubbing it in” or is the impact of his policies really being priced into the market?

Will the Fed turn dovish under this political pressure?

2025-07-16,"Intel bagholders, I got one question for you...","Why aren't you buying more?

While you regards are circle jerking over NVIDIA's $4T market cap, Jensen is furiously dumping shares to add to his personal jacket collection. Meanwhile, Intel is playing the long game.

NVIDIA's GPU dominance is built on training hype and datacenter porn, but they're about to get steamrolled by the most predictable trend in computing history: eventually, everything runs on a fucking potato.

Here's what's really happening, GPUs weren't designed for AI, AI was designed around GPUs. We're literally running neural networks on graphics cards because that's what was available, not because it's optimal. Now that specialized training and inference hardware is coming, this whole house of cards falls apart.

Not every company is training GPT-5. Only for the top players does this even make sense. The real money isn't in the repurposed graphics cards powering today's model training. It's in the purpose-built, boring-ass processors that'll run AI inference on every toaster, doorbell, and sex toy in existence. And Intel is positioning to own that world.

# Dismantling NVIDIA's hype

Let me break this down for you mouth-breathers. Most of you have no idea what CUDA actually is or why it doesn't matter. The funny thing is neither do the companies or their developers building these AI models using it.

I'm a Platform Engineer. Which means I'm the poor bastard who has to productionize and scale the garbage that AI teams try to ship. Let me tell you, most AI ""engineers"" code like toddlers with crayons. It's embarrassing.

Picture this, you've got these script kiddies sitting in their Herman Miller chairs, MacBook Pros gleaming under the open office lighting, staring lovingly at their golden NVIDIA GPUs like they're some sort of religious artifacts. Like you, to these ape-like engineers, CUDA is simply magic. A godlike ethereal force aligning all the fairy dust just right in their $40,000 golden shrine to Jensen.

But it isn't.

CUDA is just a C++ extension with some runtime libraries. That's it. The ""moat"" everyone keeps parroting about doesn't exist because ALL the software frameworks used in the industry support multiple backends. PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, they all run on AMD, Intel, custom silicon, whatever. The hardware is completely abstracted away. Most developers never even know what backend they're running on.

These people have zero concept of basic software engineering principles, let alone understanding the backend infrastructure their code runs on. They're statisticians and researchers who learned to use a computer the same way a medieval alchemist learned to use fire.

They believe that if it runs on their MacBook, it's production ready. They write code like they're still submitting homework assignments, except now their homework is burning through millions in compute costs.

# A Fundamental Shift is Coming

At the moment, companies everywhere are conflating training requirements with inference requirements like they're the same thing.

I've seen production deployments at major companies that would make any competent engineer weep. Burning millions per year on H100s because they can't differentiate between development and production requirements. Companies treating every ML workload like they're training GPT-5.

These deployments only exist because companies throw unlimited capex budgets at fundamentally misunderstood architectures just to get a ticket on the AI hype train. But it's not sustainable.

Training requires massive parallel compute for backpropagation. Fine, NVIDIA won that round with their Ferrari hardware. But the market is shifting from training to inference, and inference has completely different optimization requirements.

Inference is single forward passes that need to be cheap, consistent, and efficient, not just fast. A Llama model classifying support tickets doesn't need a $25,000 H100. It needs cost-effective compute that can handle steady loads without breaking the bank. These workloads are perfectly suited for whoever can deliver the best price to performance story. Literally anyone else but NVIDIA.

You can only burn through VC money and corporate budgets for so long before someone starts asking uncomfortable questions. The corporate bean counters are getting nosy about what these ""AI initiatives"" are actually producing for their massive compute spend. When finance realizes they're paying Ferrari prices for Honda Civic workloads, the free money party ends fast. And where does it go? To Intel, AMD, and every custom silicon vendor with a better price-to-performance story.

Remember DeepSeek? When they claimed comparable performance using 2,048 H800s versus competitors' 10,000+ H100s, NVIDIA lost $589 billion in market value in one day. That wasn't market overreaction. That was the market briefly glimpsing reality about AI efficiency.

If that's the market reaction to a boost in training efficiency, imagine what happens when the inference efficiency story becomes undeniable.

Specialized inference chips are already showing 5-20x performance improvements over general-purpose GPUs. When companies realize they can run their workloads on cheaper, more efficient hardware, the migration will be swift and brutal for NVIDIA's margins.

Intel's Gaudi 3 baseboards are delivering 2.9x better price performance to NVIDIA's H100 baseboards.

Meanwhile, Intel trades like a dying company when they're positioned to capture the massive inference market that everyone's ignoring. The technical setup screams bottom, the valuation is absurd, and the fundamental shift is accelerating.

# The Trade:

Positions:

INTC 2600 shares, selling covered calls every other week, selling puts with available cash as collateral.

The way I see it, you're getting paid to wait on a potential 2-3x if the turnaround works. And if it doesn't, you're buying below tangible book value while NVIDIA holders watch their gains evaporate.

INB4 ""why aren't you buying puts on NVIDIA?"":

Listen, that stock has more momentum than a freight train on cocaine. Maybe it keeps ripping to $300 while I'm crying into my positions. But physics applies to stonks too, and what goes parabolic eventually comes back to earth.

I'd rather bet on the inevitable winner of the post-hype reality than try to time the peak of an irrational bubble.

The way I see it, you're getting paid to wait on a potential 2-3x if the turnaround works. And if it doesn't, you're buying below tangible book value while NVIDIA holders watch their gains evaporate.

INB4 ""why aren't you buying puts on NVIDIA?"":

Listen, that stock has more momentum than a freight train on cocaine. Maybe it keeps ripping to $300 while I'm crying into my positions. But physics applies to stonks too, and what goes parabolic eventually comes back to earth.

I'd rather bet on the inevitable winner of the post-hype reality than try to time the peak of an irrational bubble.

2025-07-24,Is 75% Net Income spent on CAPEX too much for GOOG?,"In April the narrative was ""Tech is spending too much on CAPEX"". It really impacted companies like MSFT and NVDA which at the time was the right call to call that bluff.

But now, with GOOG coming out declaring it wants to spend upwards of 75% of its net income on CAPEX. Is it too much going forward?

GOOG's CAPEX has increased from a 49% average pre 2016, to a current average of 54.2% of its net income. But now it wants to spend nearly 75% for estimated 2025 Net income. And says it'll increase even more in 2026.

A bigger concern is that all this infrastructure has a high attrition rate. Servers need replacing on a 5 year cycle. So the likelihood expensive buildouts now will persist later is a problem as well.

At what point is the CAPEX expenditure too much? ",162,102

2025-07-24,Not all top 10 tech stocks are the same,"A lot is being said about the high valuations and long outperformance of the tech stocks and how risky and overvalued they are as a bunch. But there's an enormous difference just among the top 10 tech stocks by size.

TSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.

PLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.

GOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.

AAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.

AMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.

MSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.

I personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted. 

Meanwhile these companies are investing nearly $300 billion in cap ex per year and have returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years. These aren't unprofitable ""dot com bubble"" stocks but entrenched cash cows.",98,65

Margins are getting squeezed by tariffs, and the market doesn't care about the long-term outlook, just immediate profits. Same story in every segment.

Also, like some other people, tech, AI, I've been DCAing into AAPL, AVGO, WRD and even a bit of MSFT again. Those moves felt smart a few months ago.  

I know people are bailing on healthcare and piling into tech now... same thing happened in reverse during April lows. The cycle is just... exhausting. But I'm still holding. Because health insurance isn't going anywhere. Premiums are going to rise next year and there's real talk about softening the policy damage.

 Rates will not come down because GDP numbers show growth and tarrifs putting pressure on this to raise prices too. Although it seems retail is absorbing the costs for now, I anticipate they won't for much longer.

Can't beat the fixed income rates now though especially for ones closer to or at retirement.

2025-08-01,AMD is evolving from a chip supplier to a full-fledged AI computing platform player,"The MI350 is close enough to Nvidia's performance that AMD can finally charge something closer to a premium price. This chip is no longer just an affordable alternative - it's being used in real-world, mission-critical AI workloads. Most importantly, this is the “early inflection point” in the changing competitive landscape you've been watching.



Revenue and margin gains are real 

At higher average selling prices, AMD has been able to grow significantly without having to dramatically increase volume. Even the relatively low volume of the MI350 ($25K) is likely to boost Q3 and Q4 results, especially considering that they will be compared to a period when China's exports were hit hard. Margins could also improve: shifting more of the GPU portfolio to higher-end SKUs will help close AMD's earnings gap with Nvidia and Broadcom - which still limits AMD's P/E ratio.



The market expects AMD's GPU revenue to be around $1.65 billion in the third quarter. If MI355X grows as expected in the second half of the year and prices move in line with expectations, AMD's revenue could be revised upward.



Major customers could be behind this move 

AMD wouldn't be pressing prices so aggressively unless major cloud service providers such as Meta ( META ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) were on board. There is growing evidence that these customers are no longer just interested in AMD's GPUs, but are actually actively deploying them. We saw early signs of this in our Q1 earnings call and earnings filings. Customers appear to be buying AMD's complete AI platform, including ROCm, system integration and long-term support.



AMD vs. Nvidia: The Price Gap is Narrowing 

Even at $25K, the MI350 is less expensive than Nvidia's B200, making AMD an attractive choice for workloads such as inference, especially among enterprises and second-tier cloud service providers that can't justify Nvidia's pricing. This creates an optimal balance of “value and performance,” and AMD is helping to lead the way in certain market segments. This marks a significant shift in the competitive landscape.



Risks remain, but the narrative is changing 

Headwinds remain. China's export restrictions could result in a revenue reduction of \~$800 million in the second half of 2025, and it is unclear if or when licenses will resume. mi355x needs to be released smoothly and continue the momentum of mi350 - any issues with the software or system will be closely watched. rocm is still lagging behind CUDA in developer adoption. Still lagging behind CUDA in terms of adoption, but improving: ROCm now offers day one support for LLaMA 4 and there are over 2 million models optimized for AMD GPUs on Hugging Face.



Overall 

This indicates a shift in AMD's strategy. It supports our broader view that the company is no longer confined to the role of low-cost alternative, but is moving towards leadership in AI computing. If these pricing trends continue - and especially if they trigger even a modest “ahead-of-the-curve” cycle - the market may begin to reassess AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a platform company. As these fundamentals strengthen, the technological breakthroughs we've seen from AMD, especially relative to NVIDIA, could begin to gain real staying power.",102,34

2025-08-04,AMD is evolving from a chip supplier to a full-fledged AI computing platform player,"The MI350 is close enough to Nvidia's performance that AMD can finally charge something closer to a premium price. This chip is no longer just an affordable alternative - it's being used in real-world, mission-critical AI workloads. Most importantly, this is the “early inflection point” in the changing competitive landscape you've been watching.



Revenue and margin gains are real 

At higher average selling prices, AMD has been able to grow significantly without having to dramatically increase volume. Even the relatively low volume of the MI350 ($25K) is likely to boost Q3 and Q4 results, especially considering that they will be compared to a period when China's exports were hit hard. Margins could also improve: shifting more of the GPU portfolio to higher-end SKUs will help close AMD's earnings gap with Nvidia and Broadcom - which still limits AMD's P/E ratio.



The market expects AMD's GPU revenue to be around $1.65 billion in the third quarter. If MI355X grows as expected in the second half of the year and prices move in line with expectations, AMD's revenue could be revised upward.



Major customers could be behind this move 

AMD wouldn't be pressing prices so aggressively unless major cloud service providers such as Meta ( META ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) were on board. There is growing evidence that these customers are no longer just interested in AMD's GPUs, but are actually actively deploying them. We saw early signs of this in our Q1 earnings call and earnings filings. Customers appear to be buying AMD's complete AI platform, including ROCm, system integration and long-term support.



AMD vs. Nvidia: The Price Gap is Narrowing 

Even at $25K, the MI350 is less expensive than Nvidia's B200, making AMD an attractive choice for workloads such as inference, especially among enterprises and second-tier cloud service providers that can't justify Nvidia's pricing. This creates an optimal balance of “value and performance,” and AMD is helping to lead the way in certain market segments. This marks a significant shift in the competitive landscape.

Apart from SPY and BRK.B, I also own 10 individual stocks. I used to own QQQ, but I decided to sell all of it and pick my own tech stocks instead. 

I was thinking of keeping them to a minimum, but I have now 10 individual stocks. I think it’s too much and I want to consolidate and have like 5-6 instead.

What would you sell (from this list) and what would you buy (preferably from this list, because I wanna decrease the number of stocks) using the proceeds from the sales:

2025-09-08,Moving from individual stocks to ETFs - best approach?,"Hello!

My background for quick orientation: 

- EU located, (so Roth IRA, 401k etc. Are not applicable for me. I am maxing out the retirement options available in my country though)
- no mortgage or other debts to worry about
- long Horizon (30+ years until retirement)

Last November I inherited decent amount of money that I decided to put into stock market for investing. Ever since, I DCA'd every month, so far 100% into individual stocks, all in US market. It got shaky in April, but after recovery I'm well ahead - I had some misses (BRK.B) but also picked many winners of this year so far - AVGO, ORCL, GOOG etc.

I know, I know, picked top tech stocks in AI craze time in a bullish market and got returns, hardly a difficult achievement. I read a lot of threads here, and recurring wisdom is that beating the market once doesn't mean I will manage to do so every year. Which is why I started thinking about moving some of my assets into ETF's and maybe other more stable instruments so my portfolio is no longer 100% individual stocks.

And now here comes the question I would love to get an advice from more experienced investors - what's the best strategy in my position?

A) keep the winners, let them run wild, cut the losses, sell my misses and move those funds into ETF's?

B) vice versa - realize the gains, move them to ETF's, keep dca'ing losses until they go back into green?

C) Just move all of it, winners or losers?

D) Leave all of them alone, and dca into ETF'S from now on instead?

E) None of the above?

All suggestions would be much appreciated.",1,5

2025-09-10,Broadcom Cements Its AI Credentials,"**Broadcom (AVGO) $342**

I first bought Broadcom more than a year ago for $150, and added more yesterday around $340, deciding to take the plunge after holding on and realizing that the price wouldn’t come down.

Broadcom (AVGO) the second largest AI chipmaker, and the leader by far in custom GPUs, and datacenter networking gear declared July quarter results that just passed estimates by a whisker.

The stock, however, rallied massively the next day as the ebullient CEO, Hock Tan talked up a massive $110Bn backlog , a new $10Bn customer and an expanding TAM for custom silicon and datacenter networking.

**The quarterly results and guidance at a glance**

* Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.69 beat by $0.03.
* Revenue of $15.95Bn (+22.0% YoY) beat by $130Mn. Broadcom’s revenue growth rest on two pillars, AI 32% and VMware 36% of sales, so an overall 22% growth is  excellent for the company.
* Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7Bn, with a 67% margin.
* A massive cash haul of 7.2Bn less Capex of just $142Mn, gave it an FCF of $7 Bn or 44% of revenue – **Very impressive.**

**Guidance was also close to estimates on supply constraints.**

The good stuff came during the earnings call, which was much more illuminating; CEO Hock Tan was very enthused about AI prospects, and talked about sufficiently faster growth and a massive backlog of $110Bn, plus he confirmed adding a new customer, rumored to be OpenAI.

This is one company and CEO, I respect tremendously. Hock Tan whose tenure was extended to 2030 by the board always talks up a big game; more importantly he delivers like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Arista Networks', Jayshree Ullal. 

**From Broadcom’s Q3 Earnings call:**

>

**Broadcom’s strengths and positive catalysts**

**AI revenue share keeps rising:** The share of AI revenue has gone up to an estimated 32-33% of FY2025 sales from 24% last year and based on management’s confidence in Ethernet and custom silicon scale ups and scale outs it should grow to $34Bn in FY2026, or 43% of sales and $56Bn in FY2027 or 61% of total sales. Broadcom’s sales and earnings multiples expand with each percentage increase of AI in the total mix.

**Ethernet can increase market share:** Management believes that hyperscalers prefer Ethernet “as one single fabric for both scale-out and scale-up,” and Broadcom’s Tomahawk switches, Jericho routers, and NICs can continue to grow and gain datacenter connectivity share over competitors like Nvidia, Arista Networks and Marvell.

**High margin SaaS continues to grow:** VMware continues to be a pillar of strength, with 17% high margin revenue growth. Besides, Broadcom is positioning VMware as an integrated AI solution with custom silicon.

**Strong margins:** Broadcom has strong 37% adjusted operating and 44% operating cash flow margins.

**Increasing TAM:** Previously, management had indicated that FY2026 AI revenue growth might be similar to FY2025 (roughly +50–60% YoY). But now, with the addition of a fourth hyperscaler, Broadcom’s 2026’s AI growth to “accelerate” beyond that rate, likely between 60 and 70%. The new $10Bn+ XPU customer has moved to production for AI server racks with shipments scheduled to begin in Q3 FY2026. This deal suggests several million custom AI chips could be delivered, aimed at AI inference workloads, which is the next big frontier as it takes over from training, and cements Broadcom as one of the biggest and preferred inference players.  Inference requires significantly more tokenization than training, which means hyperscalers will have to continue investing, to continue getting higher throughput at lower costs, which is key to Broadcom’s success. The $110Bn backlog that Tan spoke of confirms that this demand is much higher than anticipated.

**Broadcom’s biggest challenge is valuation, 20x FY2026 sales growing at 22%, leaves it with little room for error. It is priced to perfection.**",30,8

2025-09-11,Sharing a VMFS LUN between ESXi 7.0 (vCenter) and standalone ESXi 8.0 — safe or risky?,"I’m testing out a migration scenario and wanted some input from the community.

Here’s the setup:

* I have a **Pure Storage array** with a LUN.
* That LUN is presented to an **ESXi 7.0 U3 host** that’s managed by **vCenter 7.0**.
* I also presented the same LUN to a **standalone ESXi 8.0 host** (not connected to vCenter, since I don’t have an ESXi 8 license right now — only eval on that box).

What I did for testing:

* Created a small test LUN.
* Unregistered a VM from the 7.0 host (in vCenter) and then registered it on the standalone 8.0 host.
* VM booted and worked fine.

What I’m considering:

* Presenting a **much larger LUN** that currently hosts \~20 VMs, with **Veeam CDP running** on those VMs on the 7.0 host.
* Then, zone that LUN so it’s visible to both hosts (7.0 in vCenter and the standalone 8.0).
* Plan: move a few VMs over to the 8.0 host while leaving others running on 7.0.

My concern:

* If I leave some VMs running on the 7.0 host and move others to the 8.0 host, is this **safe**?
* Or does having one host outside of vCenter accessing the same datastore put me at risk of **file locking issues, VMFS metadata corruption, or breaking Veeam CDP**?

The reason I’m running ESXi 8 standalone is simple: **no license for vCenter 8.0** right now. I can’t add that host into my existing vCenter 7.0 environment.

Has anyone here run mixed environments like this? Did it work out, or did it bite you? Any official docs/KBs would be awesome too.",2,0
2025-09-12,Oracle phenomena - “legacy” players pushing AI reaction?,"The recent case of Oracle got me thinking about the state of the markets, the AI hype and reality, and what it means for the future.

I’ve been pretty skeptical about Oracle’s surge, but they are about to recognize a lot of revenues. This market reaction is interesting because so far, the “big AI” bets were companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, Google, Meta, Broadcom, etc. Oracle, by contrast, has long been seen as more of a legacy play, focused on infrastructure for large enterprises.

What we’re seeing is that investors still go crazy for AI, especially when an established, “old guard” player gets involved. Is this an overreaction? Hard to say. Ideally, markets should value not just AI mentions and vision, but the actual value being unlocked. Maybe that’s exactly what’s being priced in here or maybe it’s an over- or underreaction, since we still don’t fully understand what AI will ultimately deliver.

Ofc there is lot more to Oracle than this but still im very curiousy

I’m curious to hear your take: are investors overestimating, underestimating, or pricing it just right? What do you think?:/

2025-09-17,China bans tech companies from buying Nvidia’s AI chips,"     China’s internet regulator has banned the country’s biggest technology companies from buying Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips, as Beijing steps up efforts to boost its domestic industry and compete with the US.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) told companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s tailor-made product for the country, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

Several companies had indicated they would order tens of thousands of the RTX Pro 6000D, and had started testing and verification work with Nvidia’s server suppliers, the people said.

After receiving the CAC order, the companies told their suppliers to stop the work, the people added.

The ban goes beyond earlier guidance from regulators that focused on the H20, Nvidia’s other China-only chip widely used for AI. It comes after Chinese regulators concluded that domestic chips had attained performance comparable to those of Nvidia’s models used in China.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, told reporters in London on Wednesday that he expected to discuss the chipmaker’s ability to do business in China with Donald Trump that evening during the US president’s state visit to the UK.

“We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,” he said. “I’m disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I’m understanding of that. We are patient about it.” 

Beijing is putting pressure on Chinese tech companies to boost the country’s homegrown semiconductor industry and break their reliance on Nvidia so it can compete in an AI race against the US.

“The message is now loud and clear,” said an executive at one of the tech companies. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it’s all hands on deck to build the domestic system.”

Nvidia started producing chips tailored for the Chinese market after former US President Joe Biden banned the company from exporting its most powerful products to China, in an effort to rein in Beijing’s progress on AI.

Beijing’s regulators have recently summoned domestic chipmakers such as Huawei and Cambricon, as well as Alibaba and search engine giant Baidu, which also make their own semiconductors, to report how their products compare against Nvidia’s China chips, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.

They concluded that China’s AI processors had reached a level comparable to or exceeding that of the Nvidia products allowed under export controls, the person added.

China says Nvidia violated antitrust law when it bought Mellanox

The Financial Times reported last month that China’s chipmakers were seeking to triple the country’s total output of AI processors next year.

“The top-level consensus now is there’s going to be enough domestic supply to meet demand without having to buy Nvidia chips,” said an industry insider.

Nvidia introduced the RTX Pro 6000D in July during Huang’s visit to Beijing, when the US company also said Washington was easing its previous ban on the H20 chip.

China’s regulators, including the CAC, have warned tech companies against buying Nvidia’s H20, asking them to justify having purchased them over domestic products, the FT reported last month.

The RTX Pro 6000D, which the company has said could be used in automated manufacturing, was the last product Nvidia was allowed to sell in China in significant volumes.

Alibaba, ByteDance, the CAC and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

2025-09-28,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising
