2024-10-02,Challenge to find stocks matching 13 attributes of Peter Lynch,"I tried to find modern examples to each attribute mentioned in Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street. Then I thought this community could find better fits and have fun together. So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.

RECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically ""perfect company."" The dream attributes of such a company go as:

***It Sounds Dull—Or Even Better Ridiculous:***

Companies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.

My examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) & The Lovesac Company (LOVE)

***It Does Something Dull:***

Companies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.

My examples: Waste Management (WM) & Stepan Company (SCL)

***It Does Something Disagreeable:***

Businesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.

My Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)

***It’s a Spinoff:***

Corporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.

Found a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)

***The Institutions Don’t Own It, and The Analysts Don’t Follow It:***

Stocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These ""ignored"" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.

My examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) & Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)

***The Rumors Abound: It’s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***

Lynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.

My examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** & Boyd Gaming (BYD)

***There’s Something Depressing About It:***

Companies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.

My examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) & Matthews International Corporation (MATW)

***It’s a No-Growth Industry:***

Contrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.

My examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) & American Water Works (AWK)

***It’s Got a Niche:***

A strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits

My examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) & WD-40 Company (WDFC)

***People Have to Keep Buying It:***

Lynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.

My examples: Procter & Gamble (PG) & Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)

***It's a User of Technology:***

Companies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.

My examples: Walmart (WMT) & Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)

***The Insiders are Buyers:***

Insider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.

My examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) & Carnival Corporation (CCL)

***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***

Companies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.

My examples: Apple (AAPL) & Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)",38,35

2024-10-08,Angry customer during my first day of retail.,"So this was quite amusing, but I was stocking shelves in the home department, which happens to be beside the restrooms. I started to hear a commotion and saw a girl walk out and yell, ""NOW THIS IS WHAT MAKES ME WANT TO CUSS!!!"" Now this being my first day, I wanted nothing to do with her. So I walked away (she didn't see me), I overheard her talking about there not being soap in the bathroom. Which is an understandable reason to feel some type of way, but she brought it to the extent of her mother going out to WALMART AND BUYING A BOTTLE OF SOAP. ""Do you want me to go buy you some soap from walmart and then return it."" The managers rushed to get her some soap and it resolved but boy... was that fun on my first day.. ",19,11
2024-10-08,Wells Fargo downgrades Amazon on slowing growth expectations & Walmart competition,"Amazon Inc. shares fell on Monday, following a rare analyst downgrade that cited concerns over margin trends into next year, which growth in the cloud computing business is unlikely to compensate for.

Wells Fargo Securities cut the stock to equal weight from overweight, with analyst Ken Gawrelski becoming one of the few analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesn’t have a buy recommendation on the stock. He also cut his price target from $225 to $183, one of the lowest on Wall Street.

Am I the only one that thinks AMZN is still undervalued? ",140,36

Wells Fargo Securities cut the stock to equal weight from overweight, with analyst Ken Gawrelski becoming one of the few analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesn’t have a buy recommendation on the stock. He also cut his price target from $225 to $183, one of the lowest on Wall Street.

2024-10-10,Angry customer during my first day of retail.,"So this was quite amusing, but I was stocking shelves in the home department, which happens to be beside the restrooms. I started to hear a commotion and saw a girl walk out and yell, ""NOW THIS IS WHAT MAKES ME WANT TO CUSS!!!"" Now this being my first day, I wanted nothing to do with her. So I walked away (she didn't see me), I overheard her talking about there not being soap in the bathroom. Which is an understandable reason to feel some type of way, but she brought it to the extent of her mother going out to WALMART AND BUYING A BOTTLE OF SOAP.

2024-10-23,Thoughts on Walmart?,"I'm considering picking up some shares but thought I'd see what the sub thinks.

Walmart's up 56% YTD which seems pretty astonishing for any retailer, let alone the largest company by revenue in the world.

Speaking of that revenue, it's grown from $524B in 2020 to $648B currently. P/E is 42 and EPS growth forecast according to Schwab for the 3-5 year horizon is 10.17%, which is higher than Costco and Target. 

Now they're moving into pharmaceutical delivery in an attempt to box out Walgreen's and CVS. It's a troublesome area, and WMT didn't fair well opening affordable health clinics, but does signal intent to continue growing revenue at a fast clip. 

Anecdotally, WMT seems like a great business. Their online and in-store shopping process has always been great IMO. I fondly remember my days in college going to the all night supercenter to find badly needed ping pong balls on a Saturday evening.

Any important facts or considerations I'm missing? Would love to see everyone else's POV.",29,62

2024-10-25,Walmart doesn’t care if you die. ,"The tragedy of that 19 year old girl needs to remind you guys that Walmart doesn’t give a singular fuck about any of their associates or your health. 

Don’t over work yourself, don’t work above your pay, don’t force yourself to work because “the team needs your help”, and keep an eye out for potential hazards in your store. 

Walmart isn’t gonna take care of you or your family, if you die. They’ll make sure they find a way to blame it on you, open up your position, and then go “What a tragedy, we’re so sorry this accident happened..” while they phone their lawyers and tell them to suit up for when your family comes to get funeral costs.

2024-10-26,“Walmart employee looked for her daughter for hours before finding her ‘charred remains’ in the store’s walk-in bakery oven”,"The 19-year-old Walmart employee who was found dead inside a Canada store bakery’s walk-in oven has been identified as Gursimran Kaur, according to a GoFundMe page created by a member of the Maritime Sikh Society in Halifax.

Kaur’s body was discovered Oct. 19 at a Walmart on Mumford Road in Halifax, according to a Wednesday statement from the Halifax Regional Police.

“The woman, who was an employee of the store, was located in a large walk-in oven belonging to the store’s bakery department,” the statement said. “It is important to note that the investigation has not yet reached a point where the cause and manner of death have been confirmed.”

The Halifax Regional Police told Fortune it has no updates on the investigation at this time.

According to the GoFundMe page, Kaur’s mother, also a Walmart worker, was unable to locate her for over an hour and could not reach her over the phone, on the night her “burned to death” body was found.

“Mother started panicking as it was unusual for her to switch her phone off during the day,” the page said. “She reached out to the onsite admin for help. As you all know now, her charred remains were found inside the walk-in oven in the bakery after a few hours.”

Kaur and her mother had been working at the Walmart location for two years, the GoFundMe page said. They emigrated from India to Canada about two to three years ago. Kaur’s father and brother are still in India, and the Sikh Society is working to bring them to Halifax “as soon as possible.” The online fundraiser has brought in over $140,000 in two days, meeting its initial fundraising goal in 10 hours.

“No one should ever die at work,” one commenter wrote on the GoFundMe page, “And no one should ever see their child in that state.”

A Walmart spokesperson told Fortune the store is “temporarily closed as we cooperate fully with the investigation.” The company has offered counseling services to employees following the tragedy.

“We are heartbroken and our deepest thoughts are with our associate and their family,” the spokesperson said. “Our focus remains on taking care of our associates and making sure they have the support they need.”

Locals have left flowers and notes outside the closed Walmart to pay respects to Kaur and her family.

Balbir Singh, the secretary of the Maritime Sikh Society, who has been in touch with Kaur’s mother, told CBC that the local Sikh community is grieving the loss and police local investigators have a responsibility to relay their findings to the public.

“It’s a really tragic incident and everybody is deeply hurt by this, and we are waiting for the police investigation to come out,” Singh said. “We would like to know what happened to this young woman.”",1636,227

Kaur’s body was discovered Oct. 19 at a Walmart on Mumford Road in Halifax, according to a Wednesday statement from the Halifax Regional Police.

“The woman, who was an employee of the store, was located in a large walk-in oven belonging to the store’s bakery department,” the statement said. “It is important to note that the investigation has not yet reached a point where the cause and manner of death have been confirmed.”

“Mother started panicking as it was unusual for her to switch her phone off during the day,” the page said. “She reached out to the onsite admin for help. As you all know now, her charred remains were found inside the walk-in oven in the bakery after a few hours.”

2024-11-19,(50k YOLO) The Walmart Tariff Gambit,"Positions:
80 87.5C 8/15/2025 @ 6.58 avg (~52k)

DD:

TLDR; Walmart is poised to easily gain +20-30% over the next year. In conjunction with incredibly cheap LEAPs (20% IV) this means the potential for two caniac combos worth of tendies. 

The Overview 
Walmart has seen almost a 30% gain since last earnings as investors are piling in on the presumption that increased automation and E-Commerce will improve top and bottom lines. What is less talked about right now is the effect the Trump administration will have on Walmart and its domestic competitors. Walmart sources almost 2/3s of its products domestically in the US. In fact, Walmart has direct relationships with US suppliers and manufacturers— this has been a core part of their business model in limiting costs (and food prices, as we will get to). Walmarts competitors, however, mostly source abroad: Target for example has almost 49% of its supplying factories based in China alone. Yea, that’s right— the same China Trump wants to slap massive import tariffs on. So what happens when Walmarts competitors raise prices? Well, there’s a couple options (all of which are either favorable or neutral to Walmart). Either A) Competitors raise prices; Walmart does not on its domestic products and they subsequently capture a much larger market share as consumers flock to cheap Walmart name brand goods (tendies) B) Competitors raise prices and Walmart uses it as an excuse to raise prices as well; profit margins go up while market share stays approximately the same (tendies) or C) this analysis is wrong and Walmart is hit just as hard as its competitors; the automation, E-Commerce platforms, and foreign markets Walmart is attempting to get market share in (and the market is obsessed with) continue to bear fruit, and we are left either up or approximately the same (kids meal tendies). This is in conjunction with the fact that Walmart has reported that consumers from all income strata have already begun switching to Walmart items from competitor’s stores (read, brand loyalty is in the gutter) making any price discrepancies between Walmart and its competitors have a magnified effect on consumer demand. 

Execution:
But why the hell would I yolo in Walmart which might only go up 20-30% if you are right instead of other, juicier stocks that could move more? It’s because the relative stability of Walmart’s stock over the past several years works massively in our favor. 7 month ATM LEAPS are priced with 20% IV in mind (+10% break even), or roughly 6.50 per option. You regards spend more time value premium on a Tesla monthly call than a year long Walmart one. This means we can eliminate much of the risk of this DD (timing the market) and exaggerate the gains from that “small” 20-30% move. We are talking a 3-4x of your investment from a -mostly- theta safe investment. And remember, that’s from at the money LEAPS. This is what makes this investment choice such a juicy opportunity for us.",278,149

Still, there is a market for both that is robust. For Target, while there has been a shift in the customers toward Wal-Mart as the middle income group became more cost conscious and there is still opportunity for longer-term profitability.

Dollar Tree seems to have a more acute challenge with a down market customer and not a lot of room to push through pricing.

2024-12-14,Coworker harassment and he used the Walmart app,"Ok, so I’ve been working at Walmart for three years now. The first few months there, I met this guy, and every shift he would repeatedly ask me for my number. I verbally told him no many times, he stopped for a few. Then a few months went by, and he asked it again but this time he wanted to know if he could take me to dinner and/or a movie, I verbally told him no. He stopped again for a few months, then after he asked again. This went on for a over year. I snapped at him another time when he asked and he stopped for a while. But he would do things to still harass me, like get up from his seat while we’re on lunch, come where I’m sitting, and peek over my phone. I yelled at him in the break room and told him that was a pet peeve of mine, he laughed and tried to play like I was overreacting but he stopped for a few months. 

In July of this year, I came to work and opened the Walmart app. Suddenly, a notification popped up on my screen that said, “Hey, you at work?” At first, I thought it was one of my team leads or my coach, but when I looked at the name, I realized I didn’t recognize it. I only knew the person by his nickname, not his real name. So, I asked my coach if he knew who this person was, and he told me.

I decided to text him back, and our conversation started off innocently enough until it took a different direction. I wasn’t sure what he wanted, which is why I responded. After my shift, my coach asked me what he wanted, and I told him that the guy had asked me out. I said no. My coach was surprised but our shift was over. 

A few months later, a hurricane hit. I heard in the break room that we could apply for hurricane relief, but I wasn't sure how to do it. He overheard me discussing this and decided to send me a message on the Walmart app to offer help. I saw his message and responded, but then he changed the subject and asked me out again. Feeling uncomfortable, I decided I had no choice but to report him. This time, I reported him to another coach. 

During my next shift, one of my team leads informed me that the first coach I had previously spoken to in July had already discussed with him the necessity to leave me alone.

The first few months there, I met this guy, and every shift he would repeatedly ask me for my number. I verbally told him no many times, he stopped for a few. Then a few months went by, and he asked it again but this time he wanted to know if he could take me to dinner and/or a movie, I verbally told him no. He stopped again for a few months, then after he asked again. This went on for a over year. I snapped at him another time when he asked and he stopped for a while. But he would do things to still harass me, like get up from his seat while we’re on lunch, come where I’m sitting, and peek over my phone. I yelled at him in the break room and told him that was a pet peeve of mine, he laughed and tried to play like I was overreacting but he stopped for a few months. 

In July of this year, I came to work and opened the Walmart app. Suddenly, a notification popped up on my screen that said, “Hey, you at work?” At first, I thought it was one of my team leads or my coach, but when I looked at the name, I realized I didn’t recognize it. I only knew the person by his nickname, not his real name. So, I asked my coach if he knew who this person was, and he told me.

I decided to text him back, and our conversation started off innocently enough until it took a different direction. I wasn’t sure what he wanted, which is why I responded. After my shift, my coach asked me what he wanted, and I told him that the guy had asked me out. I said no. My coach was surprised but our shift was over. 

A few months later, a hurricane hit. I heard in the break room that we could apply for hurricane relief, but I wasn't sure how to do it. He overheard me discussing this and decided to send me a message on the Walmart app to offer help. I saw his message and responded, but then he changed the subject and asked me out again. Feeling uncomfortable, I decided I had no choice but to report him. This time, I reported him to another coach. 

During my next shift, one of my team leads informed me that the first coach I had previously spoken to in July had already discussed with him the necessity to leave me alone.

2024-12-24,Then go to Walmart then 🙄,"This customer came into where I work and asked me if we did price matches. He saw a vacuum and said that he also saw it at Walmart for a cheaper price. The store I work at is closing so everything is on sale, and the price it rings up is the price that it is. I’ve never been asked that before, so I told him that we didn’t do price matching and that I doubt we would since the store is closing and what he was asking about is already on sale. He had the audacity to walk away and say “maybe that’s the reason why the company is going out of business” or something along those lines. People are so rude and for what? If you saw it cheaper somewhere else then go to where you saw it. A customer that I was checking out heard what he said too and thought it was rude. I think it’s dumb to expect every store to do certain things. It’s okay to ask about it but to give a rude response when you don’t hear what you want to hear is immature af. ",45,9

Can someone give me advice on if it's better or worse to buy high priced stocks such as GOOG, APPL, JPM, COST, etc which are very high cost stocks vs cheaper stocks like WMT, CSCO etc. For context I am putting over 50% into SWPPX and SWLGX, I also have a pension and max out my Roth TSP, so I'm looking at my Roth IRA as more a place to be able to perhaps take more risk in it. I'm 41 and only just started my Roth IRA.

So my thinking is for example is it better to buy 2 shares of stock A at $200 per share or 8 shares of stock B at $50 per share, or no difference? I'm smart financially but not the best at stocks and in my brain it seems like stocks inherently have a ceiling and so lower stock of a strong company is better than higher stock of also a strong company.

I really dgaf about how you feel about politics, if you don’t want to make money, that’s on you babe. Remember it’s not corruption if it’s legal! Tariff exemptions aren’t cheap! 

Of course as always some of the bribes—I mean donations—are by individuals who invest above our normie level like Sam Altman or Citadel hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, Timothy Mellon (yes the old school oligarch Mellon! I told you they’re making a come back!), Florida Crystals, or Pratt Industries if you don’t like that, well, try to stop corrupt people from becoming president!

Sorry the format sucks lol.

As you can see, the Oligarch Index has currently outperformed the S&P 500 by 30% since the election. Some of the companies like Ford which would benefit from protectionism haven't even shot up yet. Plenty of room for growth!  

I really dgaf about how you feel about politics, if you don’t want to make money, that’s on you babe. Remember it’s not corruption if it’s legal! Tariff exemptions aren’t cheap! 

Of course as always some of the bribes—I mean donations—are by individuals who invest above our normie level like Sam Altman or Citadel hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, Timothy Mellon (yes the old school oligarch Mellon! I told you they’re making a come back!), Florida Crystals, or Pratt Industries if you don’t like that, well, try to stop corrupt people from becoming president! In the mean time, profit as much as you can! If you think I missed any, put it in the comments!

Sorry the format sucks lol.

As you can see, the Oligarch Index has currently outperformed the S&P 500 by 30% since the election. Some of the companies like Ford which would benefit from protectionism haven't even shot up yet. Plenty of room for growth!  

I really dgaf about how you feel about politics, if you don’t want to make money, that’s on you babe. Remember it’s not corruption if it’s legal! Tariff exemptions aren’t cheap! 

Of course as always some of the bribes—I mean donations—are by individuals who invest above our normie level like Sam Altman or Citadel hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, Timothy Mellon (yes the old school oligarch Mellon! I told you they’re making a come back!), Florida Crystals, or Pratt Industries if you don’t like that, well, try to stop corrupt people from becoming president! In the mean time, profit as much as you can! If you think I missed any, put it in the comments!

2025-02-14,"January Retail Sales Drop, Pointing to Possible Economic Slowdown","January saw a sharp pullback in consumer spending, suggesting a potential slowdown in economic growth, according to a Commerce Department report released Friday. Retail sales dropped 0.9% for the month, following an upwardly revised 0.7% gain in December.. Much worse than the expected 0.2% dip. These figures are adjusted for seasonality but not inflation, which rose 0.5% during the month.

Excluding auto sales, retail spending fell 0.4%, missing the forecasted 0.3% increase. A critical “control” measure, used to calculate GDP by stripping out nonessential categories, dropped 0.8%, erasing the previous month’s 0.8% gain.

Since consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, this decline raises concerns about weaker growth in the first quarter.

**Key Figures:**

* **Sporting goods, music, and bookstores**: -4.6%
* **Online retail**: -1.9%
* **Motor vehicles and parts**: -2.8%
* **Gas stations & food & drink**: +0.9%

The data suggests consumer momentum may be fading, leaving myself and probably many others wondering how the economy will fare moving forward.

2025-02-18,No receipt return for a contest prize?,"Hey all, I recently won a contest for a nice meat smoker (Pit Boss 5 series vertical smoker, msrp ~$550), but I dont really want the item. It's brand new/unopened, so I thought I could return it for store credit somewhere without a receipt. I tried Walmart since I saw online that they sell this particular smoker, but they said they cannot process no-receipt returns more than $25. Is this normal? I don't want to try to scam a company into letting me return it, but I dont know what other options I have. I am actively trying to sell via online forums like Facebook marketplace or Offerup, but there just doesn't seem to be a market for it, even when I'm selling at a huge discount.  

Update*: I do know that it was paid for at full price as there was an invoice from the manufacturer included when it was delivered. But, the manufacturer will only process returns by refunding the original purchase card. ",0,14

I understand, blue chip, Tech/Ai is the future. Google, PLTR, Walmart, AAPL (maybe), and others would be good moves. But I’m just curious what ya’ll think. Something you could dump 10k into, forget the password and check back in 25-30 years and it’s 50k… or more.

Thoughts?

EDIT: ok 50k is more of an index fund answer, let’s say 10k to 100k “easy” 10x (or more) over 30 yrs ",0,76
2025-02-19,Question about Walmart stocks,"Hey I posted this in Personal Finance already but I didn't know if this would be a better place.

I am looking for a suggestion. I was, up until today, a Walmart associate with what seems like a pretty good stock matching program. I accrued about 13 shares in the company, big deal, I know. I mean, I'm a paycheck to paycheck kind of guy so it's a decent chunk of change for me. Anyways.

My question is how should I handle these shares now that my employment has ended? I think the account could potentially stay open but I don't know if that's safe or good for long term. Currently it's in an account I access through an app called Computershare and tbh I don't know what brokerage account holds my shares. There is an option in the app to transfer to another broker but I don't know what broker or account would be a good idea? I'm really really trying not to cash it out and looking for a way to keep it safe (from me mostly lol) and let it grow, if possible?

Anyways, all ideas are helpful. Thanks in advance!",1,13

> Stock futures moved lower Thursday, a day after the S&P 500 hit a fresh all-time high, while retail giant Walmart slid after issuing a disappointing outlook.
*****
> Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 110 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures shed 0.2% each.
*****
> Dow member Walmart dropped more than 7% after the company said it expects fiscal year sales to grow between 3% and 4%. The company’s fiscal 2026 earnings outlook, meanwhile, was also below analyst expectations. The weak guidance overshadowed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that topped estimates.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a winning session, with the S&P 500 on Wednesday posting another record high. The Nasdaq Composite and the 30-stock Dow also finished in positive territory as investors shrugged off President Donald Trump’s warning of more tariffs.

*****
> Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 110 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures shed 0.2% each.
*****
> Dow member Walmart dropped more than 7% after the company said it expects fiscal year sales to grow between 3% and 4%. The company’s fiscal 2026 earnings outlook, meanwhile, was also below analyst expectations. The weak guidance overshadowed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that topped estimates.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a winning session, with the S&P 500 on Wednesday posting another record high. The Nasdaq Composite and the 30-stock Dow also finished in positive territory as investors shrugged off President Donald Trump’s warning of more tariffs.
*****
> “We have been using the word ‘resilient,’” Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at JPMorgan Wealth Management said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Wednesday. She added that she expects another high single-digit total return upside from here.

2025-02-25,Paper Bags,We have a plastic ban bag in our state. Some stores offer paper bags. I’ve noticed Safeway and Walmart the paper bags are shorter. Other stores they are normal size.  It’s been this way for quite a long time.  Any idea why some stores are using smaller paper bags. You end up needing more.  At stores that charge they are full size. Only explanation I could think of was for small orders. But again when you get a large bagged order you end up using more.  ,3,2

Whether through good business strategy or the Trump administration helping his friend Elon (Tax rebates etc). You put £20k in a tax free ISA and I wouldn't be surprised if you double that or more within a year.

2025-03-08,Why is Walmart to blame for most department stores going out of business?,"Kmart which was once America's favorite store is believed to have been   killed by Walmart because Walmart likes to ""low-price"" everything. In order to compete with Walmart's low prices in the late 90's, Kmart introduced the ""BIG Kmart"" format in order for that company to stay afloat with their profability as they struggled to adapt to competition, modern technology schemes and supply chain. When Kmart went bankrupt in '02 and had to close stores to reduce debt, we blamed it on.... Wal-Mart!

Kmart bought Sears to help save the company in '05 but while they tried to bounce back from their depression, the global recession, Fast Eddie Lampart's real estate opportunity greed and online shopping like Amazon and Walmart (of course!) took a toll on both Kmart & Sears.

If Kmart didn't buy Sears, maybe Sears could've still been relevant today right?

In New England, we had Ames, Bradlees and Caldor in the 90s and guess what happened to their companies? People stopped shopping at these stores once Walmart opened stores nearby both Ames, Bradlees and Caldor stores in some of these cities that had both of either stores.

2025-03-16,Technically hired but still haven’t started,"I had an interview Tuesday and was hired on the spot. The person that hired me wasn’t able to have me complete everything I needed to at the moment because the store was kind of busy. She put me in the system as being hired or whatever, and she had me do another application thing. I finished it at home. I messaged her the same day telling her I finished it.

I’ve done online orders at my last job, but I worry about not being able to find things that I’ve never seen or heard of before. I wonder if I call them if they’ll still have me do an interview.

2025-03-24,Should I go back to retail?,"I’ll try and keep this short and sweet. Last year I made a career change. I was a store manager for a retail chain in a small town part of a bigger company. I was good, real good, I’m not just saying that to be cocky, I was told I was good, turned things around for the store, very involved with the local community. I loved parts of it, mainly the people aspect of it. I like working and dealing with people. But the job itself was a big headache. I worked lots of hours, felt like I lived there. My phone was constantly going off with texts, emails, phone calls. Split days off, sometimes having to go in on my days off, sometimes working open to close. It was a lot. And I was paid decent for the area I live in but not as much as one would think, I was definitely underpaid for everything I did, but again for the area I live in, it was actually pretty good. But I was getting burnt out. I was exhausted. I knew I didn’t want to do it forever, I’m not sure how people in retail management do it for years and years. I had only done it a few and it aged me mentally pretty good. But I wasn’t sure what else I could do because I was pretty good at this job, it paid decent for my area. 

But then the unthinkable happened. I had done such a good job and got noticed by a bank. (Random I know) but I knew a couple people at this bank do it wasn’t completely random. But they said they had noticed all the work I had done and how hard I worked and they’d like to recruit me to be apart of their team. It was about 8k more a year, obviously a better schedule (Monday-fri) 8-4. Benefits were better. All in all sounded like a great package! I took it. I’ve been there a little less than a year now. I like it. It’s slower pace than what I was used to and I’m still learning and getting the hang of things. I’m still getting used to my coworkers and such. It’s been an adjustment. I miss people, interacting with customers daily and working closely as a team, but I don’t miss the headaches and stress. I’m in a better mental spot now than I was with retail. I have the weekends to do whatever I want. I can come home feeling like I have some energy left. It feels good.


But I’ve been having thoughts. I have a friend who works at Walmart, in management. They have a store lead position open. To my understanding store leads can make like 80k + big bonuses. I know he gets good benefits and lots of time off. However it’s still retail, there’s still headaches and long hours. But that salary and bonus is tempting. 

I’m it even sure I’d be eligible to even apply for this position since I don’t even work there but he told me to apply if I wanted. I may not even get it. But just kinda wanted to talk it out and see what others think? Am I crazy?",6,7

2025-03-25,How safe do you think WMT (Walmart) is as an investment long term? Is retail dying? Specifically the types of products Walmart sells,"I haven't done too deep research into retail, but I just know anecdotal that retail for myself and people I know is significantly diminishing. Amazon and other online retailers are the go to, and even when you go into a store you are likely comparing prices to online anyways and choosing which is cheaper, which usually is online.

  
That combined with Walmart carrying mainly cheap chinese products doesnt seem like they have great retention of buyers and diminishing revenue when those cheap chinese products are EVERYWHERE.

  
The thing that saves Walmart is definitely groceries and other daily services are products they carry which are convenient and well priced.

  
I obviously dont see Walmart going out of business or struggling any time soon in the short term, but I am thinking 10-20+ years from now will it still be the same powerhouse company?

  
Can you guys give some insight on their fundamentals and what your outlook is on Walmart in like 10+ years? It seems like their P/E ratio is pretty solid, I just cant help but think they will turn into a bed bath and beyond eventually. Maybe that will come well after I'm dead.",27,144

2025-04-09,"I have a question, honestly want to know the answer. Why do cashiers not use the belt at checkout as it’s intended?","I see this everywhere. At locations like Safeway, Walmart, Fred Meyer, etc. any place where you load your items on a belt that is designed to carry them to the cashier. 

Yet, in almost every case, the cashier turns it off and reaches across it to grab what items they want to scan. 

This is problematic for a few reasons. One, you’re gonna kill your back. The job is already rough on your body as it is, but reaching like that will make it worse. 

Two, if the belt doesn’t advance, the next customer can’t load their items. It’s irritating to stand there with some items loaded, not being able to load more, while there’s empty room up front because the cashier isn’t letting the belt advance. 

I used to be a cashier (actually am one now in a place that has a counter, not a belt). I get wanting to plan your packing and that customers often put their items up in no logical order. But when I worked with a belt, I always let it bring the items to me and used the area around me to plan bagging. 

I really don’t understand why you make more work for yourself, risk injury, and slow down the process? ",43,42

News: [US Stock Futures Rise As Dip Buyers Emerge After Selloff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/us-stock-futures-rise-as-dip-buyers-emerge-after-selloff)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-China retaliates with an 84% tariff on US goods. The tariff escalation adds further pressure- Apple has flown literal planeloads of iPhones out of China but that's obviously a stop-gap measure. We've seen AAPL fall to $169, massively beyond what I could have even hoped. Still flat this but probably the #1 play if expecting a tariff reversal- the White House and Trump have signaled that tariffs are here to stay. Currently long a little from $170, but will bail if we hit those prices premarket/at the open.  

**Related Tickers:** AVGO, QCOM, SWKS (all iPhone part manufacturers)

[**WMT (Walmart)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WMT&p=d), [**TGT (Target)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TGT&p=d)\-WMT scraps quarterly operating income forecast, citing Trump’s tariffs. They did cite net sales growing 3-4% this year. WMT backing away from guidance signals the ""we are in danger"" alarm over tariff impact on import costs and consumer demand even with net sales growing. TGT, with similar exposure, is likely to experience margin pressure in coming quarters. Margins are squeezed massively (and retailers are likely to take a loss on some goods simply because it's untenable to continue selling for a loss). 

[**DAL (Delta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAL&p=d)\- CEO states Trump tariffs are hurting bookings, and was unable to reaffirm guidance. Forecasted Q2 EPS of $1.70–$2.30 vs. $2.23 est. Revenue to range -2% - +2% YoY vs. +1.9% est. Tariff fears hitting forward travel demand are a red flag, especially international bookings. Airlines face multiple macro pressures—tariffs, softening travel sentiment, currency exchange fluctuations, etc, overall a different set of circumstances from COVID yet as deadly. 

[**TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TLT&p=d)\-Massive afterhours move as China sells U.S. Treasuries, resulting in a 5 point move afterhours. Bloomberg is also citing an unwind of popular hedge fund trade. The scale and consistency of the move suggest a structural shift, not just positioning.

2025-04-29,Exclusive | Walmart tells some Chinese suppliers to resume shipments amid trade war: sources,"The American retail giant will reportedly also bear the cost of any new tariffs, after the escalating US-China trade war slowed deliveries to a trickle. 

Some manufacturers in China’s Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces – export powerhouses that have been hit hard by the US-China trade war – have been told by Walmart and other major US retailers to resume shipments in recent days, the Post has learned.

A major exporter of stationery and office products in the eastern city of Ningbo received a notification from Walmart on Monday to resume normal deliveries to the United States, weeks after a series of tit-for-tat tariff hikes between the world’s two largest economies slowed shipments to a trickle.

The costs of the new import duties will be borne by the US clients, the firm said.

2025-04-29,Walmart has told Chinese suppliers to resume shipments - SCMP,"[Source](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3308290/walmart-has-told-some-chinese-suppliers-resume-shipments-sources)

Walmart and other US retailers have told some Chinese suppliers—especially in Jiangsu and Zhejiang—to resume shipments after a slowdown caused by escalating tariffs.

A Ningbo-based exporter confirmed Walmart instructed them to restart deliveries, with the US retailer agreeing to cover the cost of new tariffs.

Mainetti, a major packaging supplier, also received similar notices from US clients as early as April 23.

Shipping terms have shifted from DDP (delivered duty paid) to FOB (free on board), allowing US importers to handle tariffs through their local customs agents.

This rebound in orders follows a sharp drop of over 40% in April.

# Inflation, Retail Sales Reports Come As Investors Watch Data Amid Tariff Developments

The weekend meetings on trade between U.S. and Chinese officials are likely to capture market watchers’ attention to start the week, with investors hopeful that trade tensions between the two nations could be easing.

Inflation will be in focus as investors get their first look at April prices with the Tuesday release of the [Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp). At last week’s Federal Reserve meeting, officials said they were looking for more improvement on inflation before moving to lower interest rates from their current levels.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on Thursday; last week, President Trump was critical of the Fed for failing to act on interest rates. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller, and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly are among the other officials expected to deliver remarks this week.

March’s CPI report indicated that inflation [dropped unexpectedly to a rise of 2.4%](https://www.investopedia.com/inflation-unexpectedly-fell-in-march-amid-tariff-turmoil-11712611), while other recent indicators have [shown that price increases are slowing](https://www.investopedia.com/inflation-was-flat-in-march-pce-measure-shows-11724760). Investors are also expecting updates on import and export prices, as well as April’s Producer Price Index, which shows inflation at the wholesale level.

Retail sales data, scheduled for Thursday, comes as consumer spending has been strong while shoppers [rush to buy items](https://www.investopedia.com/will-consumer-fears-show-up-in-the-march-retail-sales-report-11714988) before tariffs take hold. Economists are looking for signs of change in spending levels, with recent consumer sentiment surveys showing that feelings about the economy are worsening.

On Friday, the latest sentiment report is expected to offer May's first look at how consumers feel about current and future economic conditions. The survey offers insights into spending patterns that can help support the economy. It follows several months of [surveys showing declining consumer sentiment](https://www.investopedia.com/falling-consumer-confidence-has-set-off-this-recession-alarm-11724208) amid worries over the administration's tariffs' impact on prices. Tuesday’s expected small business sentiment report could further signal the economy’s direction.

The homebuilders' confidence survey, scheduled for Thursday, and Friday’s expected housing starts data, will highlight inventory supply trends during a period in which housing scarcity is helping [drive affordability problems](https://www.investopedia.com/want-a-view-of-the-housing-affordability-crisis-these-numbers-show-the-trend-11688451).

Investors will also be looking at Thursday’s scheduled industrial productivity report for data on the manufacturing sector. Monday’s planned release of the monthly federal budget for April will provide an update on government debt levels.

# Walmart Earnings Come as Investors Watch for Consumer Spending Trends

Walmart’s scheduled quarterly report on Thursday leads the weekly earnings calendar, as market watchers seek information on consumer spending and economic conditions amid [uncertain U.S. trade policy](https://www.investopedia.com/walmart-costco-likely-to-fare-well-under-tariffs-ubs-says-11708483).

The retail giant reported prior-quarter earnings per share and revenue that came in ahead of analyst expectations, but its [outlook was weaker than expected](https://www.investopedia.com/walmart-earnings-q4-fy25-11681695) as the company said it was evaluating the impact of tariffs on its business.

Cisco is expected to report on Wednesday after the network infrastructure provider posted higher revenue in the prior quarter on [increased AI orders](https://www.investopedia.com/cisco-earnings-q2-fy2025-11678867) and approved a $15 billion increase to the company’s [stock repurchase](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/041702.asp) program. Semiconductor maker Applied Materials’ report scheduled for Thursday comes after it said in its [previous quarterly earnings report](https://www.investopedia.com/applied-materials-stock-slips-on-predicted-china-sales-headwinds-11679922) in February that sales could be negatively affected by recent limitations on chip exports.

Take-Two Interactive’s Thursday earnings report will drop as the video game maker builds excitement for its [latest release](https://www.investopedia.com/a-new-gta-trailer-has-take-two-stock-rising-again-today-11729304) in the Grand Theft Auto game franchise. Deere’s report on the same day will provide a look at the agricultural sector.

Nuclear power startup Oklo’s report on Tuesday comes after it recently reported that its [losses widened in 2024](https://www.investopedia.com/oklo-stock-sinks-as-losses-widen-reversing-some-of-monday-gains-11702768). Investors in the power provider include OpenAI’s Sam Altman, which has raised investor optimism that the company’s services could be used to [meet energy demand for AI infrastructure projects](https://www.investopedia.com/trump-announces-usd500b-ai-joint-venture-with-oracle-openai-and-softbank-8778027).

Investors will also be following scheduled earnings reports from Chinese e-commerce companies Alibaba, [JD.com](http://JD.com), and Tencent Music Entertainment.

# Inflation, Retail Sales Reports Come As Investors Watch Data Amid Tariff Developments

The weekend meetings on trade between U.S. and Chinese officials are likely to capture market watchers’ attention to start the week, with investors hopeful that trade tensions between the two nations could be easing.

Inflation will be in focus as investors get their first look at April prices with the Tuesday release of the [Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp). At last week’s Federal Reserve meeting, officials said they were looking for more improvement on inflation before moving to lower interest rates from their current levels.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on Thursday; last week, President Trump was critical of the Fed for failing to act on interest rates. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller, and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly are among the other officials expected to deliver remarks this week.

March’s CPI report indicated that inflation [dropped unexpectedly to a rise of 2.4%](https://www.investopedia.com/inflation-unexpectedly-fell-in-march-amid-tariff-turmoil-11712611), while other recent indicators have [shown that price increases are slowing](https://www.investopedia.com/inflation-was-flat-in-march-pce-measure-shows-11724760). Investors are also expecting updates on import and export prices, as well as April’s Producer Price Index, which shows inflation at the wholesale level.

Retail sales data, scheduled for Thursday, comes as consumer spending has been strong while shoppers [rush to buy items](https://www.investopedia.com/will-consumer-fears-show-up-in-the-march-retail-sales-report-11714988) before tariffs take hold. Economists are looking for signs of change in spending levels, with recent consumer sentiment surveys showing that feelings about the economy are worsening.

On Friday, the latest sentiment report is expected to offer May's first look at how consumers feel about current and future economic conditions. The survey offers insights into spending patterns that can help support the economy. It follows several months of [surveys showing declining consumer sentiment](https://www.investopedia.com/falling-consumer-confidence-has-set-off-this-recession-alarm-11724208) amid worries over the administration's tariffs' impact on prices. Tuesday’s expected small business sentiment report could further signal the economy’s direction.

The homebuilders' confidence survey, scheduled for Thursday, and Friday’s expected housing starts data, will highlight inventory supply trends during a period in which housing scarcity is helping [drive affordability problems](https://www.investopedia.com/want-a-view-of-the-housing-affordability-crisis-these-numbers-show-the-trend-11688451).

Investors will also be looking at Thursday’s scheduled industrial productivity report for data on the manufacturing sector. Monday’s planned release of the monthly federal budget for April will provide an update on government debt levels.

# Walmart Earnings Come as Investors Watch for Consumer Spending Trends

Walmart’s scheduled quarterly report on Thursday leads the weekly earnings calendar, as market watchers seek information on consumer spending and economic conditions amid [uncertain U.S. trade policy](https://www.investopedia.com/walmart-costco-likely-to-fare-well-under-tariffs-ubs-says-11708483).

The retail giant reported prior-quarter earnings per share and revenue that came in ahead of analyst expectations, but its [outlook was weaker than expected](https://www.investopedia.com/walmart-earnings-q4-fy25-11681695) as the company said it was evaluating the impact of tariffs on its business.

Cisco is expected to report on Wednesday after the network infrastructure provider posted higher revenue in the prior quarter on [increased AI orders](https://www.investopedia.com/cisco-earnings-q2-fy2025-11678867) and approved a $15 billion increase to the company’s [stock repurchase](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/041702.asp) program. Semiconductor maker Applied Materials’ report scheduled for Thursday comes after it said in its [previous quarterly earnings report](https://www.investopedia.com/applied-materials-stock-slips-on-predicted-china-sales-headwinds-11679922) in February that sales could be negatively affected by recent limitations on chip exports.

Take-Two Interactive’s Thursday earnings report will drop as the video game maker builds excitement for its [latest release](https://www.investopedia.com/a-new-gta-trailer-has-take-two-stock-rising-again-today-11729304) in the Grand Theft Auto game franchise. Deere’s report on the same day will provide a look at the agricultural sector.

Nuclear power startup Oklo’s report on Tuesday comes after it recently reported that its [losses widened in 2024](https://www.investopedia.com/oklo-stock-sinks-as-losses-widen-reversing-some-of-monday-gains-11702768). Investors in the power provider include OpenAI’s Sam Altman, which has raised investor optimism that the company’s services could be used to [meet energy demand for AI infrastructure projects](https://www.investopedia.com/trump-announces-usd500b-ai-joint-venture-with-oracle-openai-and-softbank-8778027).

Investors will also be following scheduled earnings reports from Chinese e-commerce companies Alibaba, [JD.com](http://JD.com), and Tencent Music Entertainment.

2025-05-15,BREAKING: Walmart to hike prices imminently,"Earnings Call On prices

""We will likely see price hikes toward the end of this month and then certainly much more in June,"" per Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey


""We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible but given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,""

2025-05-15,Walmart is going to miss earnings,"Heyy. So Walmart seems to be a good, investible company. I foresee revenue shrinkage here in the US and will talk about that in this post. So let's start with the basics.

So Walmart has only missed earnings estimates **five** **times** **since 2015**. Walmart tends to do well with revenue growth. This earnings tomorrow morning will be time number 6. 

Last earnings report, walmart lowered their guidance and **expected to lose money this quarter because of** ***Tariffs*****.** I am making this post not because of tariffs, but because of ***Deportations***. I will not be taking any stances in this post--just talking about the theoretical impact on their revenue.

  
So to start, let's get some basic demographics down. In the United States, around 18.9% of the US and are the second largest racial/ethnic group after nonhispanic whites. Below is a photo to show the ten states with the largest representation of hispanics. There are an estimated 62 million hispanics.

[California and Texas are the biggest two. Going all the way down to Arizona and New Mexico. ](https://preview.redd.it/nsxgzi47xr0f1.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f0038e0dd29896216fbaa52122b6d00bc72db63)

So now we need to look at Walmart's consumer data. Walmart estimates that about .14 of their customers are hispanic. Now, this [website](https://www.contimod.com/walmart-statistics/#:~:text=Walmart%20serves%20over%2037%20million,6.25%25%20from%202023%20to%202024\) has a bunch of other data on the consumer that you could look at if you want to, but these are the important numbers.

  
**The Impact on expedited deportations**

  
According to this [website](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/mass-deportation), illegal immigrants produce quite a significant chunk of the US economy. The immigrants usually pick agriculture or construction work and pay quite a bit to businesses and our governments without receiving benefits like a citizen would. I don't think I need to say, but if agriculture product is harder to get, that leads to slower supply lines, leading to higher demand, leading to higher prices to offset the cost, not to mention the inflation we've already been seeing. Simple supply and Demand.

  
**This part is speculation**

  
I live in a town with a large number of hispanic people here. Me hablo un poco español de colegio. This, just as a source, wouldn't suffice because anecdotal evidence is fallacious. That being said, let's do a thought experiment. Let's say our non english or little english-speaking amigos see that ICE are ramping up deportations, xenophobia is rising and the hispanics are experiencing more of that, etc etc. How do you think they are going to act? I think that if they fear deportation, are upset with xenophobia, and want to stay as ""safe"" from ICE as possible, they will stay with hispanic areas as much as possible. This will drive away revenue from previous places they were shopping at and create small business opportunities with their friends/family that do have legal status and can open shops. My speculation is that walmart did not account for a drop in hispanic customers when they lowered their guidance last quarter. So let's do some math.

  
Walmart has 8 billion shares in its company and netted 5.254 bill in income. With division, this comes to .65675 or .66 EPS. They lowered their guidance last quarter to .59 EPS for this quarter from tariffs affecting goods. Now, I think that some very educated people know their stuff and I will not argue with that number based on tariffs. I think that tariffs and inflation probably did have a big effect on walmart. However, I do want to show some speculative math here. Let's say that the .14 or 14% of their hispanic customers dropped to 10% this quarter which is a pretty big jump, that will have changed their income to 4.729Bill or 

**.591125 or .59 EPS**. Now I don't have many metrics I would need for better estimation such as average ticket, cost of goods, etc. but that EPS is not accounting for tariffs. 

  
**Positions**

I have two walmart 93$ Puts expiring on 5/23. 

[I know I am poor I work at Wendys](https://preview.redd.it/ix5ysjld2s0f1.png?width=1305&format=png&auto=webp&s=85a46265a5288db0ab10c7aff773dbf6966b15a3)

I have also prepared my banbet on the daily thread when I was up at 2 lmao.

2025-05-15,"Walmart CFO says price hikes from tariffs could start later this month, as retailer beats on earnings","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/walmart-wmt-q1-2026-earnings.html


> Walmart on Thursday fell just short of quarterly sales estimates, as even the world’s largest retailer said it would feel the pinch of higher tariffs.  Even so, the Arkansas-based discounter stuck by its full-year forecast, which calls for sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share for the fiscal year. That cautious profit outlook had disappointed Wall Street in February. Walmart also marked a milestone: It posted its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business both in the U.S. and globally. The business has benefitted from the growth of higher-margin moneymakers, including online advertising and Walmart’s third-party marketplace.  In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said tariffs are “still too high” – even with the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days. 

> “We’re wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,” he said. “It’s more than any supplier can absorb. And so I’m concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You’ll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.” Walmart said it expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earning per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.

> Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the three-month period that ended May 2 compared with Wall Street’s estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

- Earnings per share: 61 cents, adjusted vs. 58 cents expected

- Revenue: $165.61 billion vs. $165.84 billion expected

> In the fiscal first quarter, Walmart’s net income fell to $4.49 billion, or 56 cents per share, compared with $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose about 2.5% from $161.51 billion in the year-ago period, but had a 1% headwind from lapping Leap Day in the year-ago period. Yet it marked Walmart’s first quarterly revenue miss since February 2020. Comparable sales – an industry metric also known as same-store sales – jumped 4.5% for Walmart U.S. and 6.7% for Sam’s Club, excluding fuel. E-commerce sales increased 21% in the U.S., marking the 12th straight quarter of double-digit gains. Global e-commerce sales jumped 22% year over year.

> Walmart is often seen as a barometer for the health of the U.S. consumer because of its thousands of stores and large customer base that cuts across age, income and region. Rainey told CNBC that Walmart has not seen a noticeable shift in consumer behavior from previous quarters. “They’re discerning. They’re mindful. They’re maybe a little concerned about possible looming price increases, but their behaviors largely have not changed. They’re still looking for value,” he said. Still, he said, Walmart plans to “play offense” by keeping its price gaps below competitors. He said the company will absorb some of the higher prices from tariffs and expects suppliers will, too.

> Unlike some of its peers, Walmart has advantages that have helped it better weather an uncertain economy and woo a more selective U.S. consumer. As the nation’s largest grocer, it sells food and necessities that drive steadier store and website traffic. And as a well-known value player, it can use lower prices to attract even middle- and upper-income customers who want to pay less. Already, Walmart has attracted wealthier shoppers with faster deliveries, store remodels and a wider assortment of brands.",273,49

My speculation is that walmart did not account for a drop in hispanic customers when they lowered their guidance last quarter. So let's do some math.

  
Walmart has 8 billion shares in its company and netted 5.254 bill in income. With division, this comes to .65675 or .66 EPS. They lowered their guidance last quarter to .59 EPS for this quarter from tariffs affecting goods. Now, I think that some very educated people know their stuff and I will not argue with that number based on tariffs. I think that tariffs and inflation probably did have a big effect on walmart. However, I do want to show some speculative math here. Let's say that the .14 or 14% of their hispanic customers dropped to 10% this quarter which is a pretty big jump, that will have changed their income to 4.729Bill or 

**.591125 or .59 EPS**. Now I don't have many metrics I would need for better estimation such as average ticket, cost of goods, etc. but that EPS is not accounting for tariffs.

2025-05-16,"Walmart CFO says price hikes from tariffs could start later this month, as retailer beats on earnings","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/walmart-wmt-q1-2026-earnings.html


> Walmart on Thursday fell just short of quarterly sales estimates, as even the world’s largest retailer said it would feel the pinch of higher tariffs.  Even so, the Arkansas-based discounter stuck by its full-year forecast, which calls for sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share for the fiscal year. That cautious profit outlook had disappointed Wall Street in February. Walmart also marked a milestone: It posted its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business both in the U.S. and globally. The business has benefitted from the growth of higher-margin moneymakers, including online advertising and Walmart’s third-party marketplace.  In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said tariffs are “still too high” – even with the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days. 

> “We’re wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,” he said. “It’s more than any supplier can absorb. And so I’m concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You’ll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.” Walmart said it expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earning per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.

> Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the three-month period that ended May 2 compared with Wall Street’s estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

- Earnings per share: 61 cents, adjusted vs. 58 cents expected

- Revenue: $165.61 billion vs. $165.84 billion expected

> In the fiscal first quarter, Walmart’s net income fell to $4.49 billion, or 56 cents per share, compared with $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose about 2.5% from $161.51 billion in the year-ago period, but had a 1% headwind from lapping Leap Day in the year-ago period. Yet it marked Walmart’s first quarterly revenue miss since February 2020. Comparable sales – an industry metric also known as same-store sales – jumped 4.5% for Walmart U.S. and 6.7% for Sam’s Club, excluding fuel. E-commerce sales increased 21% in the U.S., marking the 12th straight quarter of double-digit gains. Global e-commerce sales jumped 22% year over year.

> Walmart is often seen as a barometer for the health of the U.S. consumer because of its thousands of stores and large customer base that cuts across age, income and region. Rainey told CNBC that Walmart has not seen a noticeable shift in consumer behavior from previous quarters. “They’re discerning. They’re mindful. They’re maybe a little concerned about possible looming price increases, but their behaviors largely have not changed. They’re still looking for value,” he said. Still, he said, Walmart plans to “play offense” by keeping its price gaps below competitors. He said the company will absorb some of the higher prices from tariffs and expects suppliers will, too.

> Unlike some of its peers, Walmart has advantages that have helped it better weather an uncertain economy and woo a more selective U.S. consumer. As the nation’s largest grocer, it sells food and necessities that drive steadier store and website traffic. And as a well-known value player, it can use lower prices to attract even middle- and upper-income customers who want to pay less. Already, Walmart has attracted wealthier shoppers with faster deliveries, store remodels and a wider assortment of brands.",273,49

2025-05-18,Trump tells Walmart to 'eat the tariffs' instead of raising prices,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Walmart should ""eat the tariffs"" instead of blaming duties imposed by his administration on imported goods for the retailer's increased prices.

His comments were in response to the world's largest retailer saying this week it would have to start raising prices later this month due to high tariffs.

""Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,"" Trump said in a social media post.

""Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, 'EAT THE TARIFFS,' and not charge valued customers ANYTHING.""

A representative of Walmart could not be immediately reached for comment.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday the retailer could not absorb all the tariff costs because of narrow retail margins. Even so, he said, the company was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise - which primarily comes from China - would not drive food prices higher.

Many U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of friction between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China, as consumers curtail spending.

As a bellwether of U.S. consumer health, Walmart's explicit statement about the impact of tariffs is a signpost for how the trade war is affecting the retail sector. Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low.

Every week, some 255 million people shop in its stores or place orders online around the world, and 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles (16 km) of a Walmart.

Walmart's disclosure comes about three weeks after a published report that Amazon planned to disclose how much Trump-imposed tariffs were adding to the costs of its products. The White House blasted Amazon over the report, which the company promptly denied.

2025-05-27,"Got wrongfully terminated, unemployment sided with me now Walmart blacklisted me for any future employment.","Just wanted to share this comical story. I was fired for having COVID with a positive test result and getting APPROVED Sedgwick leave of absence for every single day I was missing from work. I called out appropriately and let HR AND my immediate supervisors know I am OUT OF WORK. Yet the store manager (now fired) terminated me when I got back. He claimed that Sedgwick leave of absence even if approved has to be approved by him afterwards and he doesn’t think Covid is a legitimate reason to call out even if I had a positive test result and fever for the entire 5 days I was out of work. 

Anyway long story short his boss (district manager) fired him a week after he fired me, Walmart lied to unemployment and tried to say I didn’t have approved leave. Unemployment got shown the evidence that I did in fact have approved leave and did the proper call out procedure. Unemployment sided with me, now almost a year later I spoke to a Walmart that wanted to hire me and they said I am on a blacklist they they’ve “never seen before”. Talk about salty.

Other retailers have been less forthcoming, avoiding the word “tariff” and instead blaming strategy shifts or price hikes on “macroeconomic uncertainty” — or simply refusing to point the finger at all.

> Many retailers have reduced or withdrawn their full-year guidance because of tariffs. Companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Macy’s and Best Buy have slashed their profit outlooks. Meanwhile, American Eagle, Canada Goose, Ross and Mattel pulled their full-year guidance.

> Economists on both sides of the aisle agree that tariffs are inflationary and the cost will likely be passed on to consumers, though government data has not showed a clear effect yet. A majority, 68%, of U.S. CEOs say they have either increased prices already or are considering doing so this year in the face of tariffs, according to a new survey by Chief Executive Group and AlixPartners.

2025-06-08,Why I am bearish on S&P and sitting tight on my puts,"I’ve been scratching my head the past few weeks watching the S&P grind higher while the macro and micro data just keep flashing warning signs. Let me lay it out:

Consumer weakness:
Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Nike, and Starbucks have all slashed their outlooks. That’s not noise. These are bellwethers across income brackets and sectors. People are clearly trading down, and the middle class is feeling the pinch.

Housing:
The iShares Home Construction ETF ($ITB) is down ~12% YTD. Housing starts have dropped 1.7% YoY. This isn’t just seasonal cooling — it looks like structural demand weakness with higher-for-longer mortgage rates pressuring affordability.

Delinquencies are rising — and not just at the margins:
Credit card and auto loan delinquencies have been steadily ticking higher. We’re not talking about an isolated spike; this is a consistent trend. Households are stretched and cracks are showing.

Yet somehow the market shrugs.
It blew my mind that traders cheered Friday’s jobs report while completely ignoring the downward revision of nearly 90,000 jobs across April and May. That’s not bullish — that’s deteriorating labor data, plain and simple.

Now ask yourself this: Why is Trump pushing so hard for Powell to cut rates?
If the economy is so strong, what’s the urgency? He sees the weakness under the surface — politically, economically, and financially.

I’ve rebalanced, loaded up on puts, and frankly, I have no idea who is still buying up here.

I’m not saying we crash tomorrow, but I’m not seeing much justification for a sustained rally either.",155,311

2025-06-12,"Can any retail stores survive the ""retail apocypolise?""","I asked this question on google and Gemeni AI presented this argument-

The traditional retail landscape has been significantly impacted by the rise of e-commerce, with many stores struggling and closing their doors. This shift is due to the convenience, wide selection, and often competitive pricing offered by online shopping. However, not all brick-and-mortar stores are doomed. Those that can **adapt and innovate** are finding ways to not only survive but thrive in the digital age. Here are some types of retail stores that are likely to succeed in the future:**1. Experiential Retail Stores:**

* These stores focus on creating **memorable and engaging experiences** for customers that go beyond just shopping.
* Examples include:
   * **Interactive displays:** allowing customers to engage with products in unique ways.
   * **In-store events and workshops:** like cooking classes or fitness lessons.
   * **Personalized services:** offering customized recommendations or expert advice.
   * **Leveraging technology:** using AR/VR for virtual try-ons or immersive product exploration.
* Companies like **Nike** and **Apple** are good examples of brands using experiential retail successfully. 

**2. Omnichannel Retailers:**

* These retailers seamlessly integrate their online and physical stores, offering a consistent experience across all channels.
* This includes features like:
   * **Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store (BOPIS):** allowing customers to order online and collect their items in person.
   * **Real-time inventory tracking:** ensuring customers know what's available both online and in-store.
   * **Personalized marketing and recommendations:** based on customer data gathered across channels.
* **Target** and **Walmart** have implemented successful omnichannel strategies. 

**3. Stores Focused on Community and Curation:**

* This approach is particularly relevant for businesses like bookstores. Small, independent bookstores are experiencing a revival by embedding themselves in their communities, carefully selecting titles (curation) that appeal to their customers, and hosting events (convening) that build customer loyalty.
* **Barnes & Noble** has adapted by expanding into college bookstores and publishing, though according to one source, it's a ""shadow of its former self"". Their success with expanding depends on their ability to offer a unique in-store experience that competes with online convenience. 

**4. Businesses Offering Convenience and Specialization:**

* **Specialty retail stores** focus on specific product categories, providing depth and expertise that customers may not find online.
* Retailers offering **convenience** like curbside pickup and same-day delivery are also thriving. 

  
There may be something to some of these. My local independent book store hosts mothly meet and greet with local authors and sometimes arrange with publishers to bring in an author for the day and the author usually sells a lot of books. Hosting events, inclding to stores that caters to childrens merchandise or that of pet owners can certainly help draw a crowd.",0,8

* Sandals
* Blue camouflage shorts
* Old black concert t-shirt
* Aviator Sunglasses
* Old and Dirty black ball cap.

I don't care how relaxed the dress code is. I'm CLEARLY not dressed for work. I haven't even shaved! I just want to sit here, eat my lunch, and listen to [a podcast](https://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm) on my day off. Anyhow, these two have finished their meal and were loitering with their drink refills, so there is nothing keeping them at their table. They decide to stroll over and start interrogating me about the business happening in the store that I am not currently working inside nor are they shopping inside.

  
I really wanted to blow up at these people, them that I'm not on the clock, and give them an ordered list of which of my (currently covered) body parts that they can kiss. Instead, I sucked down my entire lemonade in one gulp, took a very large breath and said ""Please let me eat my chicken sandwich. If you want to talk about Walmart business, I will be available at the store tomorrow night... during the fireworks."" Then I just stared at them until they left.

Retailers recorded online sales growth of 30.3% during events that included Amazon Prime Day, Adobe said on Saturday, compared with [its projections of ](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-set-lift-us-online-sales-238-billion-adobe-estimates-2025-07-07/)28.4%.

Online retail sales in the U.S. rose 11% to [$14.2 billion a year ago](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-boosts-us-online-sales-142-bln-adobe-says-2024-07-18/).The Prime Day event has also been cemented as a ""back-to-school"" shopping moment, as consumers jumped on early deals to stock up on essentials and get ahead of the back-to-school rush, Adobe said.

Several major retailers including e-commerce giant [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) [(AMZN.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AMZN.O), Walmart [(WMT.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/WMT.N), Target [(TGT.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TGT.N) as well as Best Buy [(BBY.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/BBY.N) have been launching deal events with strong discounts, encouraging shoppers to trade up on expensive items they might normally pass on.

[Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) extended its sales window to 96 hours, up from the typical 48, featuring aggressive promotions on categories ranging from apparel to electronics.

A wave of enticing deals comes at a time when heightened trade tensions amid the Trump administration's volatile tariff policies have rattled consumers and businesses, and as the new August 1 deadline for countries to renegotiate trade agreements with the United States looms.

According to the report, shopping on mobile was the dominant transaction channel during the Prime Day event, driving 53.2% of online sales, above Adobe's forecast of 52.5%.

According to Adobe, overall discounts across U.S. retailers were between 11% and 24%, compared with the prior forecast range of 10% to 24%.Apparel had the biggest deals at 24%, compared with 20% last year, while electronics were at 23%, similar to last year.

1. Sedgewick makes determinations using ""case workers"", the majority of which have no medical training whatsoever. They will also hire their own doctors to overrule your OWN doctor, when they neither have you chart, or personally diagnosed/seen you.

2. If you have a chronic illness, you can usually request to take 2-3 days a month off or whatever under FMLA, ***IF*** you have worked 1,000 hours and have been there a year. This severely punishes people with chronic illness from ever working there to begin with.

3. If you have something that requires immediate medical attention, for example I had rotovirus, and it might take 2-3 weeks to see your normal doctor, guess what? Most ER's and urgent care places do NOT handle Sedgewick paperwork.

So then what happens? Well you will incur points or have to use precious PPTO, meaning Walmart is perfectly fine with you coming into work while puking and shitting your brains out. Rotovirus is Norovirus's mean nasty cousin and he means business! Rotovirus can last up to EIGHT DAYS (Noro is typically 1-2)

You MIGHT be able to get your primary care doctor to fill out paperwork, but now a week has past and the virus is long gone. So now you are fucked either way.

2025-08-20,Target plunges 10% premarket as EPS falls 20% to $2.05 and comparable sales drop 1.9%,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-beat-low-earnings-expectations-as-shares-plunge-103016404.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-beat-low-earnings-expectations-as-shares-plunge-103016404.html)

Target (TGT) continues to miss the mark on earnings day.

The results on Wednesday morning aren't as shockingly bad as the first quarter, but the retailer is still struggling to find its place in the new economic norm of more discerning shoppers.

Target's second quarter earnings narrowly surpassed consensus forecasts as it wrung out cost savings. The company also maintained the full-year outlook it slashed three months ago.

But headwinds from a pressured US consumer, an influx of tariffs from the Trump administration, market-share loss to rival Walmart (WMT), and operational challenges were apparent.

Target's comparable sales fell 1.9% from a year ago, led by a 3.2% drop at its stores. Comparable digital sales increased 4.3%. Gross profit margins declined to 29% from 30% a year ago.

""While we're not pleased with the results, we're encouraged by the improved performance as we go into the third quarter of the year,"" Target chair and CEO Brian Cornell told me by video call.

Prior to earnings day, Target's stock was down 23% in 2025, compared to Walmart's 13% gain. It shed 9% in premarket trading on Wednesday.

Fixing what ails Target is about to be someone else's responsibility.

Target is tapping a homegrown talent as its next CEO at one of the most pivotal moments in the company's 63-year history.

The discounter announced that longtime CEO Cornell's heavily groomed No. 2, Michael Fiddelke, will take over as CEO on Feb. 1, 2026. Cornell, who has been CEO of Target since August 2014, will slide into the executive chair position for an undetermined period of time. Fiddelke joined Target in 2003 as an intern and rose through the ranks to CFO and then COO.

2025-08-21,Why Did Walmart's Stock Fall?,"Why is Walmart's stock tanking when its US sales are actually doing better than expected? It seems like a contradiction.. record sales growth but a falling stock price and a profit outlook miss. 

What am I missing here? Is this a sign of broader economic issues, or is it just a classic case of Wall Street being too focused on short-term profit margins?",1,61
2025-08-21,Walmart hikes sales and earnings outlook even as it says tariff costs are rising,"Walmart on Thursday raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook as its online business posted another quarter of double-digit gains, even as the company said costs are rising from higher tariffs. 

The big-box retailer topped Wall Street’s quarterly sales estimates but fell short of earnings expectations, the first time it missed on quarterly earnings since May 2022. The company said it felt pressure on profits for the period, including from some one-time expenses, such as restructuring costs, pricier insurance claims and litigation settlements.

Walmart said it now expects net sales to grow between 3.75% to 4.75% for the fiscal year, up from its previous expectations for 3% to 4%. It raised its adjusted earnings per share outlook slightly to $2.52 to $2.62, up from a prior range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share.

In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said the company is working hard to keep prices low – including speeding up imports from overseas and stepping up the number of Rollbacks, or limited-time discounts, in its stores. 

“This is managed on an item-by-item and category-by-category basis,” he said. “There are certainly areas where we have fully absorbed the impact of higher tariff costs. There are other areas where we’ve had to pass some of those costs along.”

But he added “tariff-impacted costs are continuing to drift upwards.” 

Even so, Rainey said Walmart hasn’t seen a change in customer spending. For example, sales of private label items, which typically cost less than national brands, were roughly flat year over year, he said.

“Everyone is looking to see if there are any creaks in the armor or anything that’s happening with the consumer, but it’s been very consistent,” he said. “They continue to be very resilient.”

Yet on the company’s earnings call, CEO Doug McMillon said middle- and lower-income households have been more sensitive to tariff-related price increases, particularly in discretionary categories.

“We see a corresponding moderation in units at the item level as customers switch to other items, or in some cases, categories,” he said.

Here’s what the big-box reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 68 cents adjusted vs. 74 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $177.40 billion vs. $176.16 billion

Walmart shares fell nearly 4% in premarket trading Thursday.

Walmart’s net income jumped to $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, in the three-month period that ended July 31, compared with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. 

Revenue rose from $169.34 billion in the year-ago quarter. 

Comparable sales for Walmart U.S. climbed 4.6% in the second quarter, excluding fuel, compared with the year-ago period, as both the grocery and health and wellness category saw strong growth. That was higher than the 4% increase that analysts expected. The industry metric**,** also called same-store sales, includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year.

At Sam’s Club, comparable sales jumped 5.9% excluding fuel, higher than the 5.2% that analysts anticipated.

Self checkout line at Target was 5 mins long, store looked empty considering it was back to school weekend. Gave me conviction for this trade. Walmart is located in the same Plaza, the self checkout line was 45 mins long.. the line ended in the middle of the store. It’s obvious that people are choosing the cheaper option when shopping.
